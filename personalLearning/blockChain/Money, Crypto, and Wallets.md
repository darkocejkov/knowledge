# Fiat

"Fiat" currency is a government-issued currency. The canadian dollar, the US dollar, the Euro (countries in the EU). 
The point being is that "money" is a form of payment, a defined way to gain and earn "points" to be always be able to make transactions (ie. "trade"). You trade money for a service. You work, providing a service, and you get money in return. 
When you go to a market, and you want to buy things - you don't have to worry that your form of currency is not accepted, because you have the legal tendar.

Technically, fiat currency has no intrinsic value. It's just a symbolic representation of the value that it holds. Since it has no *real* value, you want your money to retain its value - sure, you might enjoy the risk of your money's value *increasing*, but is that worth the risk of your money being worthless?
- Governments are able to regulate their money, and try and do a lot of things to hold the value of money stable

The fun part is when you get to storing money. The government may issue money, but **banks** are where you store money. Banks are private entities, and are not necessarily tied to the government, but banks definitely can influence the value of money.

When you "store" your money in a bank, you're not vaulting your money.   Your physical money is definitely NOT going to be the exact same money when you ask for it back. This is because banks are businesses, and use your money to invest. Banks issue a promise to you that your money is stable, and that it is "in debt" to you because there is an inherent risk. Canadian banks are very stable, and as a regular person - your money is protected by the CDIC. If you put in money into a CDIC-backed bank, you are guaranteed your money.

Similarly like banks invest your money at a risk, you can use *credit*. Even though you may have a total of 10,000$ stored in the bank, the bank can allow you to use *credit* to use on anything you want. Credit is not your money, it's the *bank's* money, that you promise to pay back.

Of course, there has to be some value added for you to accept this trade. Banks have different account types you can create, which kind of are like drawers that you can allocate money into. There's different benefits, and drawers usually cost some money to use as well, because you're using the bank's service at a cost.

Some "drawers" are things like Mututal funds, which are a more personal agreement about the investing money thing. You agree to the bank that it can use your money specifically to invest, and as a reward, you gain money over time, in the terms of interest.

Not only does holding your money in banks make it secure to hold, but different banks offer different services along with your money. In 2023, how awful would it feel to have a bank which only gave you your money's worth in GOLD back, did not offer online banking, or any ability to easily make transactions digititally or easily though banking cards?
The gain of money should be incredibly high, because most banks offer a lot of ease-of-use / quality-of-life services.

## Ease-of-Use
It's commonplace now (2023) to have banks offer many services to you in different ways to use your money. Those come as a cost to the bank you decide to use. However, pretty much all banks support digital and easy banking methods.

## Debt
When you are in debt to someone else, you owe them something back. If I gave you 10$, I lost that money. If I gave it to you on the expectation that you would give it back, then I'm waiting for it back. 

Borrowing money from each other imposes an inherent risk, and it's often times unavoidable to borrow. Banks have gotten smart and attached a price to this borrowing. Instead of a *flat* price, like it costs 10 dollars to borrow money, so I expect $borrow + 10$ in return - it *scales* with the amount of money and time. If I expect you to pay the money back in a month, then once a month, I'll add on a percentage of how much you owe back into the amount you owe. The "percentage" is called **interest**.

That's how the "cost of borrowing" works.

# [Crypto](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/cryptocurrency)

Crypto "currency" can be very tricky, because it's surrounded in technical terms. It is fundamentally different in terms of how transactions are made and value is determined.

## Blockchain
Cryptocurrency is made possible by the *blockchain*. In Fiat currency, the all transactions go through the bank - they are the intermediary of all transactions, because they have to make sure that any transactions you make are valid. 
- the problem there is that banks are private businesses, and they can decide what is valid and what isn't, the control taken away from you entirely, and the value of your money.

It would be pretty cool if we had some way to have:
1. a list of all transactions
2. a way to verify those transactions
3. authorities that are committed to the validity of the transactions

Blockchains are exactly that, they are "decentralized" forms of governing transactions, meaning that there is not a single party more involved than any other to decide the validity of transactions. The true rules of transactions always stay the same.

Blockchains solve the problem of the ability to have some bad actor manipulate transactions at all. Why? because this "decentralization" means that *everyone* on the blockchain can see (and verify!) the interactions that happen on the blockchain. That's the crux of blockchains, because if someone altered any "ledger" of transactions and tried to "submit it", then absolutely everyone else could look at their ledger, and see that it either a) never happened b) involves different amounts of currency, and the bad actor cannot fake everyone out.

Blockchains is what crypto is based off of, because if you think about it, every transaction you make is public, and you can use transactions to transfer cryptocurrencies that you own to other people. 

## "block" + "chains"?
Blockchains get their name from the structure of the ledger. Each interaction is a block, that gets put on the "chain" of interactions. Each block is a permanent transaction.

## Blockchains for *money* vs. *others*
Blockchains aren't only for money or currency. They're a really slick solution to the idea of verifying transactions for money usage, but can be used for a LOT of different things.
Instead of creating a real cryptocurrency, we can implement a system of transactions in a game using blockchain concepts.
Imagine the Steam marketplace. You have an inventory of tradeable items, so does everyone else. The Steam marketplace can be converted to the blockchain, because we can use the blockchain to hold *all* user's trade transactions, and can verify new transactions based on the old ones. 
This person is trading their "Dragon Lore AWP" for a "Doppler Fade Karambit" knife, means that we can verify if both parties are making a valid transaction, put that on the blockchain, and is permenantly visible.

## "Public" transactions?
Since blockchains are digital, and not tied to governments, they do not use real identification like your legal names - because they don't care at  all about those. Your identifiers are purely based on cryptographic numbers and letters, you get assigned an entirely unique ID that lets you commit public transactions without giving away your personal information, or even what the transaction was *about*. This way, there's a layer of anonymity, so you can pay for anything with crypto, and it's very difficult to trace back the person.

## "Mining" cryptocurrency?
When BitCoin first blew up, it became such a big thing to "mine" currency, as if you were getting free money that just kept on growing. Everyone was *so* confused about what mining actually was, and how to do it.

Mining is actually trivially simple. You run a program, the program does work, as a result of the work, you gain cryptocurrency. 
I initially thought that the "work" was in the form of solving equations, generating random numbers, etc... the work that you do is actually to verify transactions. It takes a lot of computation power to verify transactions.
- The type of work that was performed was optimized for GPU calculations, so it's a major reason why lots of GPUs were entirely sold out for long periods of time. Certain cards perform better at their price point, so miners would buy as many as possible.
Obviously, there's no "free" aspect to this. More crypto = more power = more energy (electricity, etc.) Your work computer *can* mine crypto, but it's slow and needs to be mining 24/7, so it's not ideal and nets you a very small amount of money at the huge cost of performance.

## Cryptocurrency
There's a lot of variance in the world of cryptocurrency, and it can be very technical, financial, and complex.
Cryptocurrency is entirely digital, and it's value is based entirely of the blockchain that it implements. 

	Oh, forgot to mention - blockchains do not rely on a single "method" of implementation. There isn't just *one* blockchain. Blockchain is a concept that can be implemented in many different ways, the important part is that it's a way to track transactions between different identities purely, in a way that is de-centralized.

A "coin" in crypto currency is digital, and then intrinsically represents the value of the blockchain's price.
- 31/03/2023, 1 BTC = $38,423.72 CAD.

# Wallets
Are a "misnomer" in the way that they don't *actually* hold your cryptocurrency like real wallets do. They're the *interface* for the blockchain - it can be software or hardware, but the main idea is that you have some way to see your holdings, transactions, assets, etc.

Since wallets all you to interface with the blockchain, it provides you with the credentials you need.
1. Public Key
	1. publically visible unique ID that is used on the blockchain to identify you, uniquely. 
	2. If someone has your public key, they can easily commit transactions to you, and vice versa.
2. Private Key
	1. access holdings using wallet, your private bank's PIN code
	2. In terms of cryptography, the private key is what "signs" your transaction, which is implementation-specific to the wallet.

## Hot vs. Cold
Hot wallets are those that are connected to the *internet* automatically, which allow you to easily use the services the wallets provide to you without manually doing so. Unfortunately, anything on the internet can be suspectible to hacking.

### Desktop
Desktop software that encrypts keys on the Hard Drive

### Web
Web applications that are hosted by some company that allow you to access your wallet through any web interface

Cold wallets, are of course, offline. They are more difficult to use, but are meant to be extremely secure (because they are offline, etc). They require more technical knowledge.

## Custodial vs. Non-Custodial wallets
These kinds of wallets are based on where the responsibility of work goes into. Custodial wallets are those in which a third-party, like a crypto exchange or a company holds user's private keys and signs the transactions on behalf of the user.
Of course, if you trust that third-party - then it's okay. Unfortunately, they're still susceptible to *bankruptcy* or hacking. Avoid using custodial wallets for large amounts of money, instead, look into non-custodial ("self-custody") wallets where *you* keep your keys safe.

### Losing your private key means that you are never able to access your assets. 
This is because there is no way to re-generate your private keys, and it's too much of a security risk to hold on to them.
