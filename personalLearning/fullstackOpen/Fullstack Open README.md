# Objectives & Tools
Why this course? Teaches you from the ground-up on what "fullstack" is, through a multi-part project, fully open-source - no registration, paywall, accounts.

> Of course, unless you want this course to count for a *credit* towards a degree offered by the Uni. of Helsinki - then you need to have an account. Otherwise, the projects and informations are entirely free.
