# What is Git?

- Git is a VERSION control software / tool. It is widely available, open source, and used very heavily. Why do we need it? Because large projects often have MANY contributors, and even more changes made to them. Version control software allows us to step away from manually saving copies of project files, because git handles that FOR us.
- Even just working on a single branch is complex enough with enough changes and people, but we can make this simpler by using multiple branches to work on segments of code at a time.

- Git allows us to effectively use branches and commits to track changes across people and purposes. We can create branches to off-shoot specific features.

## Remotes

- A git *remote* is essentially a cloud / remote COPY of the repository
