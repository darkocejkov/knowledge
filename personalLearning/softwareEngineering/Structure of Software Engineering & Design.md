# Breakdown of the various *responsibilities*
There are very many roles and responsibilities that must take place when creating applications, and does not change for **web applications**. This is because there are so many tools and processes that must happen to construct the infrastructure of an ever-changing web application. This is heavily rooted in the core tenets of software engineering, in which we must design, plan, and manage projects.

There is a lot more to dealing with developing, releasing, and evolving a web platform/application than just a code editor, and server commands.

> Software engineering requires the involvement of the whole *systems design* process, because large-scale applications and software need to be properly planned, scoped, and have the support of excellent architecture to be able to sustain the various cycles of development.

> After all, developing as a *career* or *daily* thing starts creating the need to look at software and development in business terms.


# Why *engineer* software?
Software as a discipline is HUGE. There are so, so, so many different languages, tools, techniques, designs, patterns, and technicalities to developing software. Software has grown from a scientific aid, to a business. Developing software costs lots of money, because it is really dificult.

Software *engineering* is a discipline that encompasses much more than just the development, because software has many more stages that it used to, as software has started to become a *service*. 

When you think of a product that can be delivered through some software, we have to start thinking about the whats, the whys, the hows, and the whens. Since software is costly to develop, we should be doing right the first time. A lot can go wrong, even when you do things right, as the software is complex, but the process of develop is ininitely more complex.

The need to engineer software and the process of developing is then needed, because attention to the planning and design is critical to the outcome of the software.

# [[Software Development Life Cycle (SLDC)]]
-> A big breakdown of the various steps it takes to build a proper application
-> Takes into consideration the repetition of releasing and fixing software, because it will always break
	- and since software is becoming a *service*, we want to not only fix old bugs, but introduce new features, and provde more enriched and informed content to the users.
