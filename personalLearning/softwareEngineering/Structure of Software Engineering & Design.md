# Breakdown of the various *responsibilities*

There are very many roles and responsibilities that must take place when creating applications, and does not change for **web applications**. This is because there are so many tools and processes that must happen to construct the infrastructure of an ever-changing web application. This is heavily rooted in the core tenets of software engineering, in which we must design, plan, and manage projects.

There is a lot more to dealing with developing, releasing, and evolving a web platform/application than just a code editor, and server commands.

> Software engineering requires the involvement of the whole *systems design* process, because large-scale applications and software need to be properly planned, scoped, and have the support of excellent architecture to be able to sustain the various cycles of development.

> After all, developing as a *career* or *daily* thing starts creating the need to look at software and development in business terms.


# [[Software Development Life Cycle (SLDC)]]
-> A big breakdown of the various steps it takes to build a proper application
-> Takes into consideration the repetition of releasing and fixing software, because it will always break
	- and because software is becoming a *service*, so modern
