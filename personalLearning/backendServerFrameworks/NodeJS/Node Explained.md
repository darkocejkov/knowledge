# What?
> 	NodeJS is a #javascript runtime (engine).  What this means is that it's an environment that allows us to write javascript code, in order to perform functions.

First off, JavaScript was built to be native in the browser environment. Browsers fetch HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, which then are ran through the browser. HTML marks up documents to build a hierarchy of parent-child relationships, CSS defines the rendering style of those HTML nodes, and JavaScript allows the manipulation of data relating to HTML nodes.

NodeJS however, is a JavaScript runtime that is INDEPENDENT of any browsers - all NodeJS is meant to is run javascript code. This lets us build applications that do all sorts of things. You can use NodeJS for a variety of industrial applications, and even just as a way to perform data manipulation, or run javascript printing functions.
- Various packages and libraries have been built for NodeJS runtimes that extend the functionality to handle all sorts of requests.
	- Express is a package that allows for NodeJS to handle network (AJAX/REST) requests by creating a "middleware", which routes 'endpoints' to functions.

Typically, NodeJS is ran on servers to handle server requests, like when clients request data to do various things.
