## Goals
1. Achieve a high-level of visual interest in terms of animations and component interaction
2. Have a performant, but also stunning visual website
3. Display key traits about myself, my education, my experience, and projects
4. Build an expandable codebase that is data-driven rather than static
	1. this means that we don't need to constantly copy+paste boilerplate over and over
5. Be able to have accessible areas (pages/views/components) to play around with new concepts
	1. 2D and 3D rendering, typography, animation, state updating, etc.
6. Have a project to work on to help refine and re-learn best practices
