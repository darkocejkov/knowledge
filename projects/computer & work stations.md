# The Situation
> Currently, the personal PC that is being used is a pretty proficient beast. It was built to last.
> The main goal was for it to be able to run plenty of graphically demanding games, which it still does (for the most part). However, times are changing and now there is a large priority for a clean, organized workspace.

> Also, Windows sucks, for development at least :/ Windows is unavoidable for lots of creative programs, and especially video games (because of goddamn DX11/12). Linux-based distros ^[Ubuntu] should be a priority for a "WORK" computer, because they minimize Windows garbage, and maximize compatibility.

#### Less gargage, more organization!

> [!important] Current specs
> - GTX 1080ti
> - i7 7700k

#### Financially viable + most logical
The most logical route when considering an "upgrade" is that I don't need to upgrade and _lose_ functionality, by  going to a Linux-only computer (assuming that I would be eliminating 1 PC for another).

In fact, it would make much more sense to upgrade a *creative* beast machine with insane GPU and CPU specs, while converting the existing computer to a workhorse.

A minimal developer workhorse focuses on :
- lots of RAM
- high speed, high threaded CPU ^[of course, more is better, but CPU and RAM are core to running programs fast+well.]
