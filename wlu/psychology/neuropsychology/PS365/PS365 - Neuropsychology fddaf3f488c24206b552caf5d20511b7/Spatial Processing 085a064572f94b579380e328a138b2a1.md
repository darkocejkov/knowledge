# Spatial Processing

- Desert ants have the ability to understand where their nest is in reference to the sun and light, and helps them get back once they find food very quicky
    - this ability is called “Dead Reckoning”, the ability to find your way back despite the environment being essentially featureless (no landmarks)
    - this may suggest that they have pretty sophisticated spatial memory, but how?

- Frames of References
    - **Egocentric**
        - objects with reference coded in respect to yourself, the actor
    - **Allocentric**
        - objects with reference to eachother

- Object vs. Landmark task on parietal lesioned monkeys
    - Focused on the *dorsal* stream of processing that is more about spatial processing
    - parietal lesioned monkeys could not learned the rule reversals based on **spatial location** of the landmark
        - meaning that the landmark is what determines where the reward will be, and lesioned monkeys cannot learn that the landmark is important
    - temporal lesioned monkeys did not suffer from the same non-learning as parietal lesions
    - the converse is true for object-bsaed tasks and parietal lesions
        - where parietal lesions perform better than temporal lesions
            - because this is mostly an object-discrimination task, and has less to do with spatial orientations and maps

- Previc’s Model of 3D Space
    - peripersonal space (reaching)  → near
        - the invisible space determined by our arm and limb reach
    - focal extarpersonal space (saccades) → far
        - anywhere where we can shift attention towards with eye movements
    - extrapersonal ‘action’ space → close
        - anywhere we can immediately action into to perform new actions
    - ambient extrapersonal space → everywhere else
        - cannot look at, cannot interact with, etc.

- Upper and Lower visual field biases of space
    - The upper visual-field is more biased and detailed for saccades (lower reaction times) and visual memory
    - the lower VF is based towards actions:
        - grasping, speed/accuracy trade-off, motor imagery, intercepting targets

- Saccades and Fixations
    - Saccades are extremely fast, so fast that they are very motion blurred and have very uninformative information. So, for the duration of a saccade, we are essentially blind to that information, because it is not useful.
    - The brain will actually remap your retinotopic fields *before* a saccade occurs to maintain the object-scene constancy that you have when you shift focus with saccades.

- Saccadic Dysmetria
    - Duhamel case studied a patient with ‘neglect’.
    - This was founded on the fact that it is physically impossible to saccade within 200ms of an event occuring.
    - While observing a focus point, two targets (A, B) appear within a timespan of 200ms, in different locations, one after another, meaning they each get less than 200ms of appearacnce.
        - The main idea was to understand if movement is based on retinal remappings such as going from FP → A → B, or based on the initial retinal projections, like FP → A, FP → B
        - It was observed that we do in fact predict/carry the representations when anticipanting saccadic movements and changing the visual field to do so.
        - Because instead of making two maps from FP to each A and B, we make predictions of how to get to B from A.
            - essentially re-mapping coordinates.
    - It was really easily done within 500ms, but much harder within 200ms, because we need to saccade to gather this remapping information.

- Depth Perception
    - Binocular Disparity
        - each eye does not see the same image because of their distancce
        - the brain blends both images, and any disparities in the images of objects become distance cues
        - not the only means of understanding depth in perception
    - Static depth cues
        - Shape & Shading
            - based on how we perceive light, if light comes raking from the top, then things highlighted on the top seem to be concave, protruding, while shaded on the top means they are embossed.
    - Dynamic depth cues
        - Motion Parallax
            - based on movement, objects closer appear to move faster than distant objects

- Motion Perception
    - lies somewhere in between the dorsal + ventral streams, but is more about dorsal since motion is about action
    - single-cell recordings (monkey) show direction-selective firings in the **middle temporal** region
        - area V5 (human), superior temporal gyrus
    - the brain is very sensitive to motion perception, large activations of V5 during optic flow
        - the ‘optic-flow’ of cohesion of random dots, only ≥ 5% of dots need to be moving in the same direction for us to be able to clock a direction
    - Structure from Motion
        - is the ability to discern the structure of objects from other objects, when they move.
    - Biological Motion
        - the point-light effects of understanding biological motion in humans through lights placed at key points of the human body
            - we can tell their actions, some inferential things like sex/gender, their gait, etc.

- Optic Ataxia
    - bi/uni-parietal lesions
    - the inability to grasp at objects presented in the periphery visual field
        - most obvious when grasping with contra-lesional hand with contra-lesional space
            - (left parietal lesion, reaching with RIGHT hand in RIGHT VF is heavily disrupted)
        - Hand vs. Field effects
            - Hand effects do not rule out the inability of the hand itself, because it is on the same hemisphere as the lesion
            - Field effects are entirely driven by the lesion
                - reaching for the object that’s in the right visual field, with your LEFT hand
    - Delaying Actions in this Ataxia (”Magnetic Misreaching”)
        - introducing delays between target display and movement of the hand in those with optic ataxias reduced errors in grasping
            - this may suggest that the automatic calculations of movement are disruptive, but more conscious calculations of movement are more percise and correct

- Automatic Pilot
    - Location STOP vs. Location GO experiment
        - GO: participants told to adjust movement when perturbations occur (ie. target changes spots)
        - STOP: participants told to not adjust movement when target changes
            - rapid adjustments are so effective that they can’t be stopped, which is an indication that this is an automatic function
    - When this experiment was ran on someone with Optic Ataxia, they were able to make conscious adjustments to changing targets in the GO conditions, but more slowly
        - but makes no automatic adjustments when told to not make adjustments, and thus could willingly stop their adjustment, outperforming controls
        - this implicates the superior parietal cortex in initial automatic movements.

**Funtional Neuroanatomy of Egocentric versus Allocentric space representation**

---

- What brain structures are involved in the two representations?

![Untitled](repo/wlu/psychology/neuropsychology/PS365/PS365%20-%20Neuropsychology%20fddaf3f488c24206b552caf5d20511b7/Spatial%20Processing%20085a064572f94b579380e328a138b2a1/Untitled.png)

50% of trials had green midline, while other 50% were red, incorporating a control color discrimination task.

- stimuli in all conditions were very similar, very clean and conscise

Egocentric → is dot aligned with the *body midline*?

Allocentric → is dot aligned with the *bar*?

- used fMRI subtraction of the color discrimination task

Data

→ dissocation between right hemisphere distinct in egocentric coding, and left for allocentric coding

→ allocentric tasks had specific activations in LEFT inferior temporal cortex, object recog/diff. might be why

→ egocentric tasks showed specific activations of bilateral fronto-parietal network

- ie. bodily awareness in motor planning + action
