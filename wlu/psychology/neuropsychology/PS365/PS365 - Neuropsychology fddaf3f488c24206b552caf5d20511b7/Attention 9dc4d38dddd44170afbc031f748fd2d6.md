# Attention

# Lecture

- Honeybees & Bumblebees
    - are great examples of attention and having good selection of environmental things.
    - as they must search the environment and attend to high reward and ignore low reward, which is called “attentional selectivity”
        - Bumblebees are in Northern temperate climates, and have higher *spatial resolution* for black and white, and color stimulus
        - Honeybees are in the tropics and subtropics, and can discriminate between colors, and have shown serial search strategies
            - Bumblebees take more direct paths to targets than honeybees do, and are less affected by distractors, which may suggest *parallel processing*
    - Temperate climates have high diversity of flowers, and require a processing path that can analyze and distinguish between different flowers’ rewards.
    - Tropical regions have sparse densities of flowers, so honeybees don’t necessarily benefit from having parallel processing.

- Definition of Attention (William James)
    - “The taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought”
    - “focalization, concentration of consciousness are of its essence”
    - “withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others”

- Where’s Waldo
    - depends on the capacity limitations of the attentional system
    - as humans, we tend to search in a serial manner, the distribution becomes challenging because there are so many different, but similar types of stimuli

- Computer Metaphor
    - Before computers, behaviorists did not consider the existence of “internal mental states”, and that only stimulus and response were necessary to explain human behavior (or any)
    - However, the development of computers gave a new paradigm to understand how the brain can process things, as inputs (sensations) get sent into the brain, and then are computed (processed) internally, that gives rise to an output (behavior)

- Sensory Register
    - the “catch all” of any incoming sensory info, that is essentially unlimited.
    - The sensory register will store all information for a brief time, before it starts to select specific information by attention shifting
    - partial recall is when subjects can recall many letters with high accuracy when asked to only recall a *part* of the entire grid (which is evidence for large sensory registers)
        - an analogy for this process is the bottleneck, for which the sensory register can catch all sensory information, and the attended information is the filtered, smaller amount of specific information that comes out of the bottleneck that we focus on.

- Broadbent’s Selection Mechanism
    - stimuli are filtered (selected for attention) at an early stage of processing
        - filters can be based on basic features (color, pitch, direction, etc.)
    - stimuli are presented, then temporarily stored, and information that has characteristics that match the filters may pass through and processed for meaning
        - which means that after filtering information, it passes into short-term memory
        - this storing of information can then influence and “feedback” into how we filter information
    - importantly, perception of the stimulus is NOT required prior to selecting its relevance
    - Dichotic Listening
        - input to one ear can be selected, while input from the other can be easily ignored
        - the ignored input does not corrupt attended input, meaning that we have strong filters

- Late selection (attention) mechanisms
    - Broadbent’s model depends on early processing of attention
    - but others, such as Cherry, suggested that attention is dependent on later processing
        - which means that all information is attended to in some way (intentionally or unintentionally)
        - filters then intensify the relevant info, while attenuating unimportant info
        - Through a “split-span” technique that shows that stimuli is processed on categories of meaning differentially.

- Cocktail Party effect
    - how can we pay attention to one person in a room full other other people that are also speaking?
    - since many different voices reach our ears with the same volume or intensity
    - the dichotic listening task when applied to full sentences shows that ignored inputs are still recognized, which means that not all information ignored is thrown away, some is processed and output. This is further evidence towards a more later processing of attention.
        - We can still identify the sex of speaker, pre-tones, reversed speech, personal pronouns even if we are ignoring inputs.
    - Thus, Broadbent’s model suggest that there are mechanical limitations on attention, while Cherry’s model suggests that we make predictions based on pre-attention calculations
        - However, how do we decide what is signal vs. noise???

- Parallel & Serial processing
    - “pop-out” targets are those in which there are high signals, and low noise
        - the speed of identification of pop-out targets are unaffected by the number of distractors
        - which is an identification of parallel processing
    - however, finding differences between very similar stimuli requires conjunction searches via *serial processing*.
    - Serial processing & searches are done to “bind” sensory information together
        - features such as color and form, because searching over an entire image can help us distinguish between patterns in images, and we need to serially comb over the entire image to get this granular information

- Single Feature vs. Conjunction
    - Parallel processing is mostly used to identify *differences* of SINGLE features
    - Feature Integration Theory
        - essentially says that search search strategies require attending objects one at a time to bind elements that require conjunction between two or more features
            - ie. “find the red O (among all others being green)” vs. “find the red X’s (among the red and greens)”
                - this basically means that having objects in a scene with differences and similarities (such as having both red AND green X’s) is a conjunction of features. it requires more serial processing to differentiate the sets of red vs. green X’s
    - Single-feature searches have reaction times INDEPENDENT of set size (the # of distractors)
    - Conjunction searches have reaction times DEPENDENT on the set size

- Vision and Attention
    - fixation of vision is really important on binding conjunctive features
    - the main question is “how do we choose where to fixate in the first place”
        - Alfred Lukyanovich Yarbus pioneered eye-tracking research, and showed that people do fixate on similar aspects of images.
        - *Eye Traces* tell us where the participant is looking
    - We can also *dissociate* attention and fixation
        - Joint attention → everyone is looking in the same direction where you are looking
        - Overt attention → your observable eye movements
        - Covert attention → shifts in attention in the absence of observable eye movements
            - an example of these is the “look-away pass” where players (NBA) look away from where they pass to, to trick your attention and catch you off-guard.
    - Herman Von Helmholtz experiment
        - ???

- Spotlight Metaphor
    - attention is like a spotlight, from place-to-place, like covert-to-overt attention
    - Posner Cueing
        - targets become either “valid” cues or “invalid” cues
        - for invalid trials, they must *disengage, shift, then engage* again.
        - this suggests that *covert* attention can be in fact directed, and holds *probability* information
            - there is an initial reaction-time advantage for *valid* cued targets are presented for **short** durations
            - for longer durations, the reverse is true, meaning that the bias switches to *invalid* targets.
            - there is also an inhibition of return to the original stimuli
                - as if the attentional system is *biased* against returning to locations that have already been processed → something that is important for efficient visual searching
        - Foraging Behaviour
            - relies on balance between exploitation and exploration
                - the inhibition of return may represent the mech. that helps us achieve the balance
        - Brain Basis

            - disengaging → right inferior parietal area
            - shift → superior colliculus
                - those with *progressive supranuclear palsy* have trouble overtly & covertly shifting attention *up and down*.
            - engage → thalamus

**Neuronal Basis of Sequential Foraging Decisions in a Patchy Environment**

---

- Foraging is a visual search that also incorporates decision making; “when should i move on to the next?”
- the Marginal Value Theorem posits that moving on to new search elements happens when there is a return from one patch that diminishs the average of environment

Done through a *virtual foraging task* on Rhesus monkeys

- The reward (juice) had a decline on “stay” conditions, and the delay on “leave” conditions was manipulated

Dorsal ACC involved in behavioural monitoring, an error correction

- also active in task switching and reward processing

Monkeys displayed an obedience to the Marginal Value Theorem

- as they spent more time in patches as travel time to next patch increases (cost - benefit analysis)

Also saw that the dACC (dorsal *angulate cingulate cortex*) firing rate *increases* with time spent in a patch

- higher dACC activation was seen in early-leave conditions
    - with a steeper rise in dACC firing for those decisions

A main question of the article was “does distance reduce the threshold to leave the current patch?”

- saw a positive relationship between neuronal firing AND travel time in the leave conditions
    - essentially showing that indeed, the threshold to leave the patch decreased, meaning that

Overall:

- monkeys behave in line with the marginal value theorem in the simulated task
- neurons in the dACC (of the rhesus monkey) track time spent foraging
- more firing predicts the decision to leave a foraging patch
- the threshold for decision to leave, is dependent on the travel time between patches
    - essentially, the longer a monkey forages, the more likely it is they will leave. however, if the environment has a dense population of patches to forage from, then the monkey is more likely to search multiple different patches dependent on how long it takes to get to the other patches
- this is a brain-basis for a complex attention-related behaviour in ecological contexts
