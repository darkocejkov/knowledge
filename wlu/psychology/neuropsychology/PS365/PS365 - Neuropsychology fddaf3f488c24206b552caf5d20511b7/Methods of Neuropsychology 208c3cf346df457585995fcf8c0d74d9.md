# Methods of Neuropsychology

# Intro. to Methods

- examples brain imaging and testing:
    - Brain Lesions
        - difference between NECESSARY and SUFFICIENT function, lesions can see changes in NECESSARY areas.
    - Neural Stimulation
        - typically through both human and animals, we directly stimulate neurons and regions and see what is perceived.
        - individuals with brain damage, or we “disable” areas of the brain, and then proceed to test them on their behavior and function
            - TMS and TDCS studies are limited in the fact that surrounding areas of the brain are also affected, or the observed behaviour comes from the disability itself, or its aftereffects.
    - Neuroimaging
        - use complex forms of magnetic imaging through properties of brain function to visualize volumes of the brain
        - the properties like metabolic changes in activity or blood magnetism as a PROXY for brain function and neural activity.
            - assesses *sufficient* function

Generally, we want to be able to use *converging* methods to be able to pin-down exactly what it is that we are seeing.

- No single method of imaging or testing can directly show us something, because the brain is extremely complex, and no method is perfect without other methods to support it.
- When we want to judge the function of an area, its much better to understand its underlying cellular structure and architecture, and how it relates through connections to other brain regions.

# Lesion Studies

- Based on the logic of **Modularity**, that specific regions of the brain control specific functions or cognitions.
    - Some functions are tightly correlated to specific areas, like the somatosensory or motor cortices, visual cortices, etc.
    - Other functions, like higher-level, more complex functions like language or memories are not localized, and function by distributing over many different brain regions.
- Sherrington did ablations in dogs to explore their motor control
    - lesions can change the behavior as the brain responds to the deficit
    - different methods of lesions like:
        - removal of tissue, chemical lesions, cooling
    - de-afferented monkeys favour the other limb, leading you to believe that the de-afferented limb is totally useless to them, but that behavior changes when BOTH limbs lack sensory information, and the monkey uses both arms equally as before.

- Human lesion studies usually use case-studies in stroke patients
    - these naturally occurring lesions through strokes and other damage are not location controlled, they are spread out and span multiple areas.
    - There are typically TWO approaches that we can take to understand the relationship between affected regions and a function
        - what functions are supported by a region? use a group of lesions in similar *places*
        - what brain regions support a function? use a group of patients with similar *deficits*

- Double Dissociation
    - Use a secondary lesion group to compare against any compensated behavior effects
        - ie. a result of the lesion to the area of interest, or a lesion in general
    - We don’t know if a lesion affects the function based on the *area* of the function itself (localized) OR, the area connects regions important to this function, and they are disconnected due to the lesion

- Limitations of lesion studies include
    - even if the lesions themselves are consistent, that does not mean that the changes in behavior are consistent
    - vice versa, we can see patients with high amounts of damage and lesions, but they still have the capability of a function, while other patients with less damage have stronger signs of impairment.
        - these may be due to the effects of neuroplasticity and the reorganization of functional areas

- Split Brains
    - lesions of the brain can affect an area of processing, but can also affect the **flow of information** to other parts of the brain, which may be important for other functions
    - for example, severing the **corpus callosum** white matter that connects both hemispheres has very subtle and specific deficits, but the corpus callosum does not *process* the information, but rather carries it

# Single-Cell Neurophysiology

- Record the response of a single neuron (through electrodes implanted into the brain)
    - We can learn a lot about single-cell and neuron function by how many action potentials we can capture over a given amount of time during a trial.
        - But, this method is not flawless, because we cannot truly know if it is the single neuron firing, or it is a group-firing. Does this single-cell translate at the population level?
        - There is also deficits in how alike the animal brains are to human brains, the same behavior or results we see in animals might not translate well to the human brain.
        - Training animals with rewards may also change the behavior of this recorded neuron
    

# Neurotypicals

- form a necessary Control group
- Cognitive Psychology methods may be concerned with the *subtraction* methodology
    - In which we measure much more simpler, discrete behaviors such as:
        - reaction time, accuracy, etc.
    - the change in performances and observed behaviors would be then due to the differences in the *conditions* that make up the study
- Clinical Testing requires the use of standardized tests that *test against the normal performance*, and we score takers with respect to these norms, and we can subdivide the domains of the test to understand more specific domains of function that patients may lack
    - can also test multiple times to understand how a deficit grows over time
        - must control for practice effects
    - when standardized tests are more complex or multifactorial, it becomes harder to understand the specific deficit

# Brain Imaging

- more of a modern approach (1970s) to image the brain

CT Scans

- have bad spatial resolution
- lesions can take hours to show up

MRI

- very good spatial resolution
- usually the 2nd resort to CT scans

Functional Neuroimaging

- involves imaging the brain during its function, to take “snapshots” of brain activity
- different methods or proxies of brain activity that we relate to test performance:
    - Electrical Activity
        - EEGs, ERPs, visual evoked potentials (VEPs)
    - Stimulation
        - TMS
    - Metabolism Functions
        - Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
        - Blood Oxygenated Level Dependent (BOLD)
        - functional MRI (fMRI)

EEGs 

- works on the assumption that electrical activity of neurons is passively conducted through the skull
- use an electrode cap to amplify and measure those signals across the skull
- used widely in clinical measures
- records globally

ERPs/VEPs

- are special forms of EEG
- use less electrodes to have a more focused area of interest
- repeat the stimulus over many trials, and gain lots of clean data with timing data that we can align the signal from the electrode to the response
- use statistics and averages to average out all the trial data to find a specific pattern that would be a marker of that neural activity in response to a trial

Inverse Problem

- ERPs have good temporal resolution
- but EEGs record globally, and there is an innate problem: the Inverse Problem. There are many different combinations of neural activities that could generate patterns, so it is really difficult to find the generator of a specific signal (ie. localizing)
- EEGs also have lots of difficulties in reaching/making conclusions about more medial regions.

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)

- uses a magnetic pulse to brain region to temporarily disable or modulate that region’s activity, and therefore, that region’s function
- not accurate in terms of spatial localization
- some areas are also not able to be affected (temporal lobe, orbitofrontal cortex, etc.)

Transcranial Direct Stimulation (TDCS)

- uses direct current/electricity to modulate function and activity

TMS & repetitive TMS

- strong uses in clinical applications
    - rTMS is used on the left frontal lobe to treat depression → this is most commonly done to replace electroshock therapy
- this method is very effective at creating excitatory or inhibitory effects that are reversible, and has precise timings for disruption.
- also has no known long-term effects

Metabolic Imaging

- measure metabolic changes (proxy) that we infer are related to neural activity, based on cellular physiology
- Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
    - inject a radioactive isotope as a **tracer,** decaying particles emit positrons. when positrons collide, the release *annihilation photons*, which go in opposite directions and are captured by the radiation detecting machine, and because there are two photons, we can approximate *where* they collided
    - this method relies on the fact that the radioactive isotope is in the blood, and is how we related cerebral blood flow and function.
        - can also couple isotopes to neurotransmitters to visualize neurotransmitter activity
- All imaging relies on Subtraction
    - have two conditions: stimulation vs. control.
        - measure the *difference* in activations between two conditions, by subtracting the control from the stimulation
        - This is because most brain functions are distributed across the brain, and in imaging, we capture a lot of activity. What matters is the *difference in activation* between conditions that would be attributed to the cause of that difference (the stimulation)
    - FC Donders was the first to use this logic
        - three different tasks, all are somewhat related based on their components.
            - task 1: press button for green light
            - task 2: press button for red light, but not green
            - task 3: press L button for red, and R for green
                - task 3 - 2 = decision making
                - task 2 - 1 = color discrimination
            - this is an example of contrasting conditions in which the conditions differ in only 1 thing
- PET vs. MRI
    - PET can track multiple metabolic processes if the process can emit a photon (like blood, or neurotransmitters)
    - PET is more invasive
    - fMRI has much greater spatial resolution AND greater temporal resolution
        - PETs temporal res. depends on the half life of the isotope that is used
- fMRI
    - measures the change in ratio between oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in capillary beds in the brain
        - based on the assumption that brain functions require oxygen carried through blood, and when task uses up oxygen from the blood, the ratio of oxy-to-deoxygenated blood changes over the course of neural activity and task
