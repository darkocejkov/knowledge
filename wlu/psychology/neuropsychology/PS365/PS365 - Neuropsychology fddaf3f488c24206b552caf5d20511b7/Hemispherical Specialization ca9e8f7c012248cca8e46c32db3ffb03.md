# Hemispherical Specialization

# Modularity & Specialization

- There were early depictions and a notion that the two hemispheres of the brain were specialized (right = rational, left = creative, artistic)
    - totally not supported by modern literature, but is a good example of being on the right track towards the idea of modularity of brain areas and the differences between hemispheres.
- Lateralization also exists in animals
    - by testing for forelimb (hand) preferences
- The evolution of lateralization may have occurred by first having BOTH hemispheres deal with perceptual processing, and since there’s a redundancy with this processing in BOTH hemispheres, the left hemisphere eventually evolved to take on more of language role as local mutations allowed different kinds of cells and areas to focus on different concepts. The right hemisphere also get to further hone the ability of perceptual processing.
- Models of Specialization
    - Gazzaniga
        - describes the “automatic” (right) vs. the “interpretation” (left) → causal explanations
    - Goldberg
        - right seeks novelty, left seeks routine
- Automatic processing has evidence to support it
    - for example, when a chess board has pieces on it, depending on it being a *random* configuration or a *chess* configuration, the differences between novices and experts of chess emerges. Expert players are able to very quickly pick-up on chess configurations that would emerge from a real game of chess, compared to the novices which did poorly on real chess configs. Experts and novices were relatively equally performing on random configurations of pieces.
        - This is an example of how things may be just automatically processed, with not much “strategy” behind the processing, as if you were thinking about the best approach to remembering the configurations, instead, it just automatically happens.

- Structural Differences in Hemispheres
    - Frontal Lobe, the right hemi. frontal pole extends more *anterior* (forward) and is wider than the left.
    - Occipital, left occipital pole extends more *posteriorally* (backward), and is wider than the right
        - This is perhaps because of the changes of speciallized areas in each, that grow with learning and push around other areas as they take up more space.
    - Planum Temporale (deep within the Sylvian Fissure)
        - up to 10x larger in the left, important for language/music perception
        - difference is larger in right-handers than left-handers
    - Brodmann’s Area 39 (angular gyrus)
        - language + praxis → larger in left
    - Dorsal Parietal Regions
        - spatial cognition, larger in right hemisphere
    - Sex Differences
        - Corpus Callosum
            - more fibres in women than men
                - perhaps women are less lateraised than men), as Aphasias (impairments in language and speech) are less severe in women
        - Longitudinal Fasiculi
            - more myelination in men, better within hemi. connectivity.

- Handedness (Left vs. Right)
    - Goldman generalized this difference in having more people on avg. being right-handed than left, is to have a good amount of conformity within the population, but not entirely, so that those with left handedness are necessary to “push the status quo” and so that the population does not stagnate in terms of evolution.
    - Left-handers are more common in elite sports (that depend on timing), warlike cultures, artistic modes
    - Left-handers however are historically “oppressed” more than right-handers, as the word “Left” in latin is “Sinistral”
    - Left-handers have less evident differences than right-handers, so not all of them have language localized to the *right* hemisphere.
        - 70% left-hemi dominant
        - 15% mixed/bilateral
        - 15% right-hemi language
    - Left-handedness may be a deterimental mutation
        - more likely to be dyslexic, die (on avg.) 9 year earlier, trauma during gestation/birth increases chance of left-handedness

- Structure & Function
    - Broca’s and Wernicke’s single case patients were able to help suggest that language was lateralized to the left hemisphere
    - Hughlings-Jackson suggested that the left hemisphere dominates language and ALL mental functions generally
    - Eklhonon Goldberg suggested that the right hemisphere dominates novel stimulus processing, and left is for routines
    - Temporal Lobectomies
        - left  vs. right lobectomies lead to differences in impairments
            - right → visual memory
            - left → verbal memory

- Split-Brain Patients
    - severred corpus-callosum to stop interhemispheric epileptic activity
    - this gives very interesting results in terms of the between-hemisphere transfer of info, like how the left-hand may not be know what the right-hand is doing
        - Akalaitis found little deficits in split-brain patients
        - Gazzaniga changed Akalaitis’ questions and methods, and looked for the different types of information that each hemisphere was specialized for
            - primarily by keeping information strictly shown to one lateral side and not the other, by using rapid stimulus timings and seperating the vision fields.
                - like for example, having two *congruent* but *reflected* shapes appear in each FOV, both someone with an intact corpus callosum and a callostomy patient can perform identically well. BUT, when the shapes are not congruent on the *same axis* (symmetrical ... ) (kind of like rubbing your belly and patting your head), callostomy patients do much better, because they have independent hemispheres that do not interfere with one-another.
                    - only really works well in a testing-format when stimuli is presented at <200ms, and
            - Different response types give different results, for example, when asking for a verbal representation of split-scene stimuli or a touch based one.
                - Callostomy patients can give a mechanical response when something is place in their *left hand,* and asked to identify using motion (and no sight) what the object is. The same object in the left-hand, however, makes it local to the *right hemisphere* functions, and then disables any way for the patient to give a good verbal response *naming* the object (because they’re not able to communicate that with their right brain)
                    - given a hammer in the left hand, they can make hammer motions to describe what the object does, but they cannot name it.
            - Callostomy (split-brain) patients also show how lateralized spatial cognition is, and how it’s primarily a right-hemi function. When asked to perform spatial orientation tasks by manipulating cubes to form a pattern, doing so with the RIGHT hand (left-hemisphere operation) makes them perform poorer than doing the same task with their LEFT hand.
            - Chimeric Faces
                - half-half faces of different people combined into one face.
                - split-brain patients become unaware of the weirdness of this stimuli. again, here we see that their response is different based on the mode of response used, so if we ask for a verbal response, their answer depends on what was shown in the RIGHT FOV, and a mechanical response is different based on what was in the LEFT FOV.
    - Caveats of Callostomy Patients
        - their callostomy is due to long-term epilepsy, so that is a big thing we need to account for
        - there is a lot of *between subject* variability
        - the cerebrum is plastic, so even in *hermispherectomies* (removal of a hemisphere of the brain), patients can recover functions
            - difficult to control for

- Language + Hemisphere dominance
    - 95% of right-handers are left-hemi. dominant for lang.
    - 70% of left-handers are left-hemi dominant
    - 15% of left-handers are right-hemi domi, while the other 15% are mixed dominant
    - How do we asses this? Using the **Wada Test** (sodium amibaribitol)
        - perform verbal + spatial tasks while *each hemisphere* is anesthetized
            - before unilateral anes. objects are presented
            - after anes. patient identifies what the objects were (either verbally or by pointing)
                - accurate verbal responses indicate that the *non-anesthetized* hemisphere processes language

- Corpus Callosum communication
    - Splenium (back 3rd/posterior) relays visual information
    - Genu (front 3rd/anterior) relays higher-order information
    - Callostomies can be partial or full
    - Does the communication that comes from the callosum *between* hemispheres indicate a **cooperation** or a **competition** of information transfer?
        - Fluctuation dominance
            - Alien-hand syndrome (not yet fully known) → damage to medial frontal, encompassing (not always) the genu part of the callosum. patients exhibit having their goals between actions *at odds* with eachother, like the left-hand putting a cig in, and lighting it, and the right-hand almost comically swipes it and throws it out.
            - the info. processing in one hemi. might be enhanced at the *expense of processing* in the homologous region of the other hemi.

- Unilateral Lesions
    - can also help us understand the mystery between which functions are uniquely impaired by certain hemisphere lesions
        - lesions in the right hemisphere (but not left-hemi lesions) can lead to impairments and consequences such as:
            - neglect
            - line orientation judgement
            - unfamiliar views of objects
            - face discrimination
            - pitch/tone discrimination (prosody)
            - emotional regulation/judgement

- Expression Asymmetry
    - Moscovitch suggests that control of emotion expressions is lateralized

- Hemispherical Spec. in Neurotypicals
    - can be measured using the same split-brain paradigm (split-vision), with very brief presentation times (< 200 ms). Here, we’re looking for more of an “asymmetry” of function, and not the complete and distinct loss of it. we can measure dependent variables such as reaction time
        - called “Tachistoscopic” presentation of a stimuli
    - Dichotic Listening
        - different stimuli to each ear
        - works on the fact that auditory processing is not entirely contralateral, there are weaker ipsilateral connections
        - we measure the bias between reporting stimuli based on the ear it comes into, and this bias represents an asymmetry in processing (a “preference”)
            - left hemisphere recalls letters better (right ear), while the right recalls the melodies better (left ear)
            - in trained musicians, this can deal with familiar vs. unfamiliar pieces, in which the left-hemisphere (right ear) processes familiar pieces better.
                - similar to how faces are perceived, familiar faces are processed better by the left while strange ones by the right.

- Theories of Hemispheric Lateralization
    - the “Material Specific” specialization
        - verbal in left, non-verbal in right
            - does not account for the different ways the *same material* can be processed
    - “Modes of Processing”
        - a Global/Local distinction of processing for example
            - a “global” bigger picture, while maintain “local” details
            - RIGHT hemi for “global” preference, LEFT hemi for “local” preference
        - Not only true for Navon figures (which are large letters composed of smaller, different letters; ie. an H made out of A’s), it works also for geometric figures
    - Differential Sensitivity theory
        - differential *sensitivity* to basic sensory features (ie. spatial frequency) in BOTH hemispheres
        - Right hemisphere for *low frequencies* (coarse coding, global object analysis, prosody)
            
            ![Untitled](repo/wlu/psychology/neuropsychology/PS365/PS365%20-%20Neuropsychology%20fddaf3f488c24206b552caf5d20511b7/Hemispherical%20Specialization%20ca9e8f7c012248cca8e46c32db3ffb03/Untitled.png)
            
        - Left hemisphere for *high frequencies* (fine-grained coding, local object features, speech comprehension
            
            ![Untitled](repo/wlu/psychology/neuropsychology/PS365/PS365%20-%20Neuropsychology%20fddaf3f488c24206b552caf5d20511b7/Hemispherical%20Specialization%20ca9e8f7c012248cca8e46c32db3ffb03/Untitled%201.png)
            
        - for different modalities (audition, vision, etc.)
        - “frequency analysis” is the breaking down of stimuli into the frequency. The silhouette, basic lighting, and color of a figure may help us tell things like gender or age (low grain, basic properties), while the identity of the figure depends on high-frequency information (details: hairstyle, eyes, eyebrows, angles, etc.)
    - Alternate Theories
        - Direct Access theory
            - the hemisphere receiving information processes it, and is why the right hemi. is poorer in performance for words than the left
        - Callosal Relay theory
            - information that is not suited to one of the hemispheres takes time and the chance for the signal to degrade on the way to the other hemi, and is the source of differences in processing speed and accuracy
        - Activating-Orienting Model
            - attention to tasks increases activation in the *dominant hemisphere* (ex. left for language), and that biases perceptual and attentional processing of *contralateral stimuli*.
    - This “low” and “high” frequency specialization is context-dependent, because low frequency stimuli compared to even lower freq. stimuli is then higher, and is thus relative.

- Left Hemisphere & Neurological Disorders
    - Anosagnosia is the *denial* of deficits or the ownership of that deficit (essentially denying that there’s nothing wrong) (by Michael Posner)
        - fits into Gazzaniga’s theory that the left-hemisphere owns the “interpretor” of actions, the causal.
        - happens in right-hemisphere impairments that cause no afferent signals to arrive, and efferent signals to not be executed
        - the left-hemisphere is siloed, and does not receive these signals eitherway, and works to rationalize or interpret to account for the disordered input
            - the delusion of the left-hemisphere: “i don’t have motor impairment, i just dont want to use my hands right now”

# Paper: Abnormal Moral reasoning in Complete and Partial Callosotomy Patients

- The RIGHT TPJ (Temporo-parietal junction) is what’s responsible for modelling & understanding the moral intentions of others, while the left-hemisphere is specialized towards language.
- The idea is that split-brain patients will have trouble *verbalizing* their moral judgements, because they have a disruption of communication between the rTPJ and left-hemisphere.
- H1: complete patients have wrong judgements
- H2: partial patients will have normal judgem
    - 3 complete + 3 anterior callostomies
- the tasks of moral judgements had a background, foreground, a belief, and an outcome of information, and a total of two different kinds of outcomes and beliefs → negative, and neutral.
    - something like foreground: “white powder is sugar” (neutral) or “white powder is toxic” (negative), and the beliefs of: “grace believes it is toxic” (negative) “grace believes it is sugar” (neutral), and an outcome: “grace puts powder in drink, and her friend dies” (negative) or “grace puts the power in, and her friend is fine” (neutral)
        - they mixed-and-matched these components, and had participants assess whether the action was right or wrong.
    - 4 possible conditions (outcome neutral, outcome negative, belief neutral, belief negative)
        - only 2 cross-conditions (accidental harm, failed attempt)
- normal subjects based moral judgements on the *belief* of the acting agent, while split-brain patients (both full and partial) based their judgements on the outcome
    - true for both accidental harms and failed attempts conditions
- this means that split-brain participants did not integrate the agent’s beliefs when making the moral judgements
- H1 was confirmed, but H2 was not, since partial (anteriorly cut) patients also had wrong moral judgements
    - this may be because the communication between rTPJ and left-hemi depends on anterior parts of the corpus callosum
