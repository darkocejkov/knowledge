# Unilateral Neglect

# Lecture

- the failure to respond to, or attend to *contralesional* stilumli (side opposite the lesion)
    - not a disorder of basic perceptual abilities, but rather a complex inability to recognize lateral perception
    - usually due to **right parietal lesions**
        - controversial: whether the inferior parietal lobe (temporo-parietal junction) OR superior temporal gyrus is the critical point for neglect
    - clinical tests for neglect often observe it for vision, called “visual/spatial neglect”
        - other forms of neglect, like multimodal neglect is common, such as auditory and tactile neglect
    - can occur after left parietal lesions, but are found to be less severe and easier to recover from (and more fully)
    - clinical tests of visual neglect often use drawings to figure out how the patient interprets the stimuli
        - such as where the patient would rate the midline of a straight line, as the line moves into their neglected FOV.
            - the rated midline is often more shifted towards their non-neglected FOV rather than the true midline, indicating that they do not recognize (they neglect) the other side of stimli.
        - or how they would draw reference stimuli, those with neglect often only draw non-neglected sides
    - neglect is not a disorder of vision or memory at its core, its rather an impairment of their internal representation of processing lateral stimuli.
        - ie. they ignore sides of vision not because their eyes don’t see it, nor do they “not remember” what they saw. they

- Spatial vs. Object neglect
    - Spatial Neglect is the total neglect of an entire space, every stimulus on the neglected side is ignored.
    - Object neglect is more of a local neglect per each object.
        - in a scene with multiple objects, an example of object-centric neglect means that each object in the scene has a neglected side
        - whereas total spatial neglect would mean the entire neglected field and all stimuli within it are neglected
    - Chimeric Faces (object neglect)
        - combination of two different left and right side faces.
            - healthy controls prefer the faces smiling on the left, which represents the right-hemisphere’s dominance of perceiving and making emotions
        - neglect patients prefer faces smiling on right, even though they “see” the whole, entire face.

- Temporal Components of Neglect
    - neglect patients tend to respond with a ‘lag’ in terms of their responses to which stimuli came first (left then right, or right then left)
        - even if the left stimuli is shown first, they tend to have more “right first” responses
    - attentional blink test
        - mainly tests visual attention
        - rapid servial visual stimuli presentation, stimuli shown sequentially with very short presentation times (15 - 75msec)
            - even at very short intervals, we can still recognize the stimuli
        - the attentional blink is presented when the next targets are shown between 180 - 270msec after the first, which are often missed
            - this represents a ‘blind spot’ of attention

- Spatial Memory
    - mental models & updating them
        - models store information about statistical regularities in the environment, that can inform future predictions
        - a study used riddles in which information gave increasing degrees of specificity
            - right brain damage patients were able to form initial mental models, but struggled to update them when presented with new information
        - another study had a computer play ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS with a strong bias of 80% paper.
            - an idea strategy to net the most wins, was to learn new statistical regularities about the behavior of the computer, and play scissors 100% of the time
                - because you win 80% of matches
                    - controls are able to quickly learn the strategy
                    - non-neglect right-brain-damage patients also learn, but not as quickly
                    - neglect RBD patients only learned after about 120 trials, and barely made adjustments even then.
        - “animorph” images of one image morphing into another
            - neglect patients require more images than healthy controls and LBD patients to report seeing changes in the image

- Neglected Information
    - if we present two houses to neglect patients, with the right one being normal, and the left on fire
        - the patients believes both houses are the same, but prefers to move into the one on the right
            - which means that the neglected info is not disregarded entirely, but it fails to impact consciousness of decisions or cognitions about it
            - an “implicit” absorption of neglected information, that influences thoughts but fails to explicitly come into conscious working memory

- Rehabilitation of Neglect
    - using lenses and prisms to “shift” the vision to the right (towards to good FOV)
    - the shift in vision allows for neglect patients to “compensate” for the shift in the opposite direction, effectively reducing their deficit
        - this is reversed for controls, for which they gain a deficit, because they were correct before shifting
    - the after-effects of shifting lead to better processing of previously neglected stimuli
    - the effects of the prism adaptation method are not limited to the adapted hand
        - and affect visual imagery, postural balance, tactile exploration
    - after-effects are most prominent 2h post adaptation
        - and can last for weeks, which is true for neglect patients
        - for controls, these effects go away after only a few trials
    - the perceptual biases can be independent of motor behaviour
    - spatial working memory (of left) and time perception (right) remain unchanged after prisms

- Theories of Neglect
    - Inattention
        - unaware of left stimuli (as it is not attended to), which can be corrected by cueing
    - Disengage Deficit
        - Ipsilesional cues lead to longer reaction-times to contralesional targets
        - This is seen in the Posner cueing scenario, where parietal damage patients have exaggerated disadvantages for responding to invalid cues when the target is in the left space
        - the disengage deficit is improved after a prism rehabilition, while the neglect still remains

**Patients With Left Spatial Neglect also Neglect the “Left Side” of Time**

---

→ we use spatial representations to represent time itself

the main question is: “Do neglect patients, that neglect representations of left space, also neglect representations of left side of time?”

Method

- 7 RBD Neglects, 7 RBD non-neglect, 7 HC
- told to remember foods that “david liked 10 years ago”, in the white hat
    - OR, “will like in 10 years” via the black hat
- the task is to recall/recognize the food and which era it represents

Results

- RBD patients recalled + recognized less *past* items than other groups
- RBD patients recalled + recognized more *past* objects belonging to the *future*.

Overall

- Having intact spatial abilities are very important to representing time
- Patients with neglect recall fewer items that are associated with the past, than did participants in the other groups
    - this is important because it shows that neglect can impact time representation, and shows us that time itself is integrated with space and depends on spatial awareness.
