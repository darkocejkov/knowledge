# What is Neuropsychology? (Jan 4)

An approach to studying/understanding the mind, based on the tools and terms of psychology, cognition, neurophysiology and cellular neuroscience, focusing on structures AND function relations. ie. How the physical brain functions and its patterns.

Neuropsychology is an umbrella term, that spans across the spectrum of cellular brain-based explainations, to behavior based explanations.

Itâ€™s useful for practical purposes because medical ways of therapy rely on the physical structure of the brain and neural substrate.

# Boredom?

Those who experience it more have a higher chance of depression, drug abuse, etc. Boredom in the context of task performance, may decrease task performance based on the variables of the task itself, how interesting and how complex the system is.

We can use a form of brain imaging such as EEG (Electroencephalography) - the measure of electrical activity of the brain. Boredom was measured with EEG in a **Go No-Go** task that measures sustained attention. People who were more bored saw decreased amplitudes in the *P3* and *ERN* areas.

This course goes from behavior based investigations, deeper into more complex methods of brain imaging and study.
We can even ask questions about *social cognition*, and *genetics* and *neuro-development*.

# Artificial Intelligence

Attempts to simulate what the brain does naturally. Things like object detection, locatization, and classification of objects in images. This can aid understanding in different areas about brain function in relation to
