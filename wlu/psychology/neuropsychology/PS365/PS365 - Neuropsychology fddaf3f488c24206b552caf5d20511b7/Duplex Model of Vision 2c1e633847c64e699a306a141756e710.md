# Duplex Model of Vision

**Rapid decrement in the effects of the Ponzo display dissociates *action* and *perception***

---

→ grasping is unaffected by visual illusions, but visual estimates are

- due to the duplex model of vision, where action (DORSAL) is seperated from perception (VENTRAL)
- asks whether illusory effects change over time, does it change differently between the different streams of perception and grasping? and also whether there is any *sharing* of information between streams.
- Uses the **Ponzo** illusion (traintracks and two lines - similar to ebbinghaus of the context and contrast illusion)
    - except it’s modified, using *corners* of walls and lines
    - using two conditions of manual estimate (perception-based) or grasping (action-based)
        - first multiple trials of manual, then grasping, then manual again.

- as predicted and expected, manual/verbal estimates were affected by the illusion, whereas the action-based grasping estimates were not.
    - the rate of change between manual trials is not significantly different, whereas the illusion effect on grasping significantly changed, to be much less effective.
    - this shows that manual estimates are not “updated” by the grasping, and the grasping is not affected by the manual estimate, meaning that these streams of processing are largely independent
- however, they show that the initial grasping illusion was driven by an *underestimation* of the short target, and no effects for the long target
    - which may represent a confounding variable in terms of the stimulus, as perhaps participants were trying to avoid edges of the background.
    - but, this bias was ‘neutralized’ over repeated trials of grasping.

# Lecture

- A lot of what we know about human vision is contributed by research done on primates like maqaques and rhesus monkeys.
    - using motion *discrimination* tasks
        - the monkeys *saccade* in the direction that they perceive motion.

        - fixation > targets on either side of the possible motion > motion of dots occurs > delay, waiting period > go, response period
            - the targets are placed in locations that correspond to *receptive* visual fields in the parietal cortex that are being recorded from
            - any activity that occurs in the delay period represents the monkey’s brain *visually biasing* one target over another, independent of motor movement.
                - recordings are taken from the *lateral intraparietal region* (LIP), which has a retinotopic map.
            - they found that LIP neurons fired during the delay period **when the motion was congruent with the target location**
                - the firing increased based on the percentage/strength of coherence (the ratio of dots going on the same or different directions).
                - this is important because its kind of like a predictor that we can use to predict which target is chosen, as if the monkey knows which target it must respond towards.
                    - as if the visual receptors in this LIP region are biasing towards useful information such as action
    - the dorsal parietal stream of vision is known because of this study, to bias visual information based on action. this region forms part of the ‘duplex’ model (1/2 streams of visual information processing)

- Illusions
    - vision is not veridical, meaning that it does not objectively represent the world as it really is, it is biased. Vision forms a construction or distillation of reality that encapsulates the gist or the main ideas of the information that is received.
        - illusions work on this concept and can manipulate what is seen based on the physiology and function of the human vision system. For example, the ‘lilac chaser’ illusion has multiple lilac/pink dots in a circle and dissappear in clockwise order, only for a very short time. this time is proportionally much smaller than the time it stays on for.
        - The lilac chaser works on abusing the normalization of vision to colors, so your eyes and brain adapt to viewing the lilac/pink, and then for the duration of dissappearance, it seems as if there is a green circle, but there is no green circle. this is because the normalization tips the color balance to be more green, and without the lilac circle, it appears as a green circle.
    - Kanizsa figures are the illusory shapes that the brain fills in, because shapes that form other shapes in their pattern create this illusion.
        - These are powerful illusions because it may fundamentally shift the judgement of brightness at the edge of the illusory figure, as if it *appears* more bright and is why we can see the illusion, but there is no difference at all.
    - Illusions work on **context** and **contrast**, we do not make *absolute* judgements of colors and brightnesses, the surrounding environment is also taken into consideration and influences the brightness we perceive of objects.
        
        ![Untitled](repo/wlu/psychology/neuropsychology/PS365/PS365%20-%20Neuropsychology%20fddaf3f488c24206b552caf5d20511b7/Duplex%20Model%20of%20Vision%202c1e633847c64e699a306a141756e710/Untitled%202.png)
        
        - For example, these circles are exactly the same level of brightness, but the left one may seem darker than the right one, because it’s a *comparison*.
    - Adaptation illusions like the lilac chaser, works on the saturation of neurons that respond to specific colors, losing sensitivity to that specific stimulus and compensating using the complementary color. Green → Red for example.
        - Adaptation also works on *motion*, so if something appears to be moving, then it transitions to something static, then the static objects appear to move as the neurons that respond to the movement haven’t stopped firing totally yet.

- Illusions are great examples of how the visual system is not **veridical** as in totally objective of the environment that is reality, but rather **constructive** and biased. The visual system works to bias certain motions or visual qualities, and ignoring others, in order to adapt to the the changing environment and bring more awareness to things that are more *important.*
    - A lot of real-world information is really noisy and constantly changing as well, so this biasing helps to make sense of things that are not clean input.

- Human visual system
    - nasal hemiretina (closer to the nose, middle) crosses over, while temporal hemiretina does not.
    - optic tract information has connections to the thalamus and then continues along *optic radiations* to the striate cortex (medial occipital regions)
        - secondary visual pathways occur from the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus in the thalamus, to the superior colliculus in the hypothal, then to the pulvinar nucleus, then the amygdala.
    - there are primary, secondary, and tertiary regions for vision processing based on cytoarchitectural differences. This shows mostly how the brain progressively constructs more complex representations of visual information.
        - typically proceeds more anteriorly.

- Monkey vs. Human
    - Area 17 in the Macaque monkey brain is a homologue the the human’s area 17, which are both used for visual processing.

    - Monkey work on brains allows us to precisely map the neurophysiology of the brain through complex wiring diagrams, based on firing rates on single-cell recordings.
    - This is how the **Duplex** model of vision was developed, as it is from Ungerleider and Mishkin model:
        - the **What/How** stream (ventral)
            - V1 > inferior temporal cortex
        - the **Where** stream (dorsal)
            - V1 > posterior parietal
    - Duplex streams
        - they both originate in the V1, and are different pathways for different kinds of information of visual fields

- How vs. What
    - *Goodale* and *Milner* suggest that the “WHERE” pathway is better described as the “HOW” pathway.
        - using patient DF who had *visual agnosia*
        - as the dorsal stream is important for the visual guidance of **action**.
    - **Magnocellular** and **Parvocellular** structures emerge at the cellular level in the *dorsal lateral genucleus* pathway (by the thalamus), and even are present near the retina.
        - The Magnocellular layers are comprised of
            - large ganglion cells, color insensitive, large receptive fields, fast and transient, which are sensitive at low contrast.
        - The Parvocellular layers are comprised of
            - small ganglion cells, are color sensitive, small receptive fields, slow and sustained, and are sensitive at *high* contrast.
    - These differences in cells are key to understanding and knowing how even early on in the visual processing, cells become specialized to be able to discriminate and operate on different kinds of visual input.
        - For example, fast motion is best suited by mangocellular layers as they respond fast (where), for a crude example. Or, the ability to recognize objects is better done by parvocellular (what/how) cells that are able to better capture detail and high contrast.
    - These M & P layers are lined by **koniocellular** layers, which are almost like a “backup” to the other layers to aid in visual processing, through having a preference in visual input. If K-cells are adjacent to P-cells, they also become sensitive to color. K-cells also project to the extra-striate cortex.
    - Again, this distinction in cells can be seen even in the retina, very early on, and appears very much at the thalamus with the differentiation of cells in the LGN, which project to the V1.
    - Just like most other things in the brain, this “duplex” model still has inter-pathway connections between the two dorsal and ventral paths, they are connected and not entirely isolated from each other. This means that there is still a distinct division of labor or parallel processing that occurs, but is not entirely absolute, meaning that they function together.

- Dorsal & Ventral pathways
    - help us to distinguish objects regardless of changes in size, lighting and orientation. The DORSAL stream can help understand visual information that facilitates action in things we see, while the VENTRAL stream helps us understand what things are.
    - VENTRAL “WHAT”
        - scene-pasing, object identification, scene-based frames of reference, relational metrics, long-term representations, ‘conscious’
    - DORSAL “HOW”
        - visual control of motor ouput (ie. calclulating and interpreting information to understand HOW to do things), effector-based frame of reference, absolute metrics, moment-to-moment computation, ‘automatic’.

- Measuring Action
    - in order to quantify exactly how the HOW stream operates, we need to operationally define action in terms of what it is.
        - We can use differences in hand grip to achieve this, such as using a *precision grip* or pincer grip, called a “small hand-aperture” or a large hand-aperture which is a whole hand grip. There are other metrics such as the *kinematics* of motion (acceleration, velocity, etc.)
            - With this information we can solidly measure the distinct calculations that are made by visual streams of HOW we calculate this information of grasping objects. The information that is processed by the HOW pathway of an object informs us of how to approach and grasp on object depending on its size.
                - This means that instead of trying to grasp *everything* with a large hand and closing in, the HOW pathway can understand the distance and size of objects, and can tell us how much we actually need to open our hands to grasp an object of a certain size.
    - The ebbinghaus illusion is a good test for the distinction of visual information processing between the dorsal and ventral streams, because it uses the advantage of the illusion to trick the visual processing
        - vision condition → report size verbally
        - action condition → attempt to reach for disc, measure aperture.
            - What they found was the *visual estimates* are fooled by the illusion, whereas the *grip aperture* was insensitive to the illusion
            - The only time grip aperture was able to be fooled, was when a delay was introduced between seeing the illusion and grasping at it, which has implications that the ventral stream influences this processing of HOW to interact and grip the object.

- Visual Stream dissociations
    - Optic Ataxia
        - dorsal-stream lesions, disorder of misguided actions
        - first described by Reszo Balint, as part of “Balint’s Syndrome”
            - the *psychic paralysis of gaze*
            - *simultanagnoisa,* inability to perceive multiple objec
    - Apperceptive Agnosia
        - lateral-occipital damage
        - object-recognition disorder, ventral-stream lesions
        - object recognition of *vision,* cannot copy drawings of objects
            - CAN recognize via touch and describe functions
            - can draw objects based entirely from memory, but not based on what they see
    - Patient DF had to act (post) or match slot angles from a distance.
        - had apperceptive agnosia
        - essnentially, this distinguises function from form. As having the goal of putting something in this slot had different results than manually and literally matching the angle of the slot.
        - they could *act* or *post*  accurately, but matching happened at chance levels.

- Other pathways
    - that do not rely on V1 cortex
    - must understand how V1 is impaired through damage
        - and also that for about 4 hours a day we’re “blind”, meaning that we don’t see through blinking for example, or those blindspots that we never consciously see like our nose or brow-bone. These don’t take away from our conscious viewing experience
        - the blindspots are where retinal cells join ganglion cells and there are no perceiving cells to take in information, but those areas are ‘filled in’ by our vision processing.
            - “Blindsight” was demonstrated by Weiskrantz, when they saw that patients with *hemianopia* could respond to *above chance* levels in locating items in damaged visual fields
            - this inherentely implies that the conscious thought of vision is not a necessary condition for behavior associated with the objects
                - this might be because of the secondary, non-V1 processed stream of visual information that comes from the thalamus and the Superior Colliculus
