# Emotion

- Can animals be bored? Do they have “inner-lives” like we do? It turns out that boredom, and other emotions, serve a behavioural purpose.
- Emotions are *subjective* evaluations of an experience, and there does not exist a separation of emotion and logic/reason. Emotions are able to be thought about consciously.

- Emotions differ in certain physiological sensations and signatures, such as heart rate, finger temperature, etc. Different colors evoke associations about emotions.

- These “emotional profiles” are almost universal, and manifest in all of us. Emotions are a conscious awareness of physiological experience.
    - Is it:
        - Experience > Emotion > Physiological
        - Experience > Physiological > Emo
            - that is, which triggers which?
- James-Lange Theory states that every emotion is *preceded* by a physical response to some stimulus
- Canon-Bard theory
    - based on the fact that cutting *afferent* connections does not eliminate emotion, and that some emotions have the same physiological responses.
    - emotions are quick, but physiological changes are slower.
    - an artificial induction of physiological sensation does not always produce expected emotion
- Two-Factor Account
    - Stanley Schacter, Jerome E. Singer
    - cognitive interpretations of emotion are *imposed* on visceral sensation, and those interpretations are dependent on the context
- Pure reason does not exist without emotional information
- Somatic Marker theory
    - couple cognitive interpretations onto physiological sensation
        - these associations are learned and controlled (unlike previous models)

- Network responsible for emotion
    - Amygdala
    - Hypothalamus
    - Mammillary Bodies
    - Hippocampus
    - Anterior Thalamus

- Kluver-Bucy syndrome
    - medial temporal lobes (bilateral)
    - compulsive eating, hyperorality, hypersexuality

- amygdala responsible for emotional *regulation*, without it, there is no emotional conditioning
- insular cortex is for *interoception* (perception of sense from inside body - heart beat, breathing, etc._
    - there are 5 stages sensations take, from the posterior insula to the anterior
        - which is kind of a sense - to - construct pathway
    - primary → homeostatic → environmental → hedonic → motivational, social

- emotions have functions:
    - basis of our subjective (conscious) experience, stimulating action (flight/fight), guide social interactions (by understanding what other people feel in empathy), and communicate intent of action
    
- emotions are perceived in the posterior **limbic** system, while the anterior controls production
    - there is a right-hemi dominance for perception
    - interestingly, perception of emotion is NOT affected by prosopagnosia
    - amygdala is involved in perceiving eye specific emotion, such as in fearful faces

- perception of emotion is important as the frontal cortex is about decision making, and uses emotional information
    - specifically in the DLPFC and the OFC

- right hemi has dominance in generating speech prosody
    - RBD patients have flat tones and cannot modulate prosody

- emotions and faces are not as we have known them, there are “Ekman’s 6 faces” (anger, happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, and disgust) and are contrary to popular belief, not as stable across cultures.
- negative emotions are judged *asymmetrically*, while positive are symmetrically

- Innate emotional expression is really difficult to fake, because to display accurate emotion you need to experience the emotion in some way
    - real smiles involve “Duchenne’s muscle” near the eye
    - real and fake expressions have different neural mechanisms

- **Volitional** facial paresis is the difficulty in voluntary (generation) facial movement, which happens thru damage to motor cortex and subcortical connections
- **Emotional** facial paresis is the opposite, where you can voluntarily generate expressions, but have difficulty in innate, which happens through damage of the PFC, thalamus, and subcortical white matter of frontal

- The emotional matrix is a way to “categorize” emotions by two factors: arousal and valence
    - arousal depends on posterior right hemi, and reticular activation
    - valence is the left frontal cortex

- Or, we can use approach and avoidance in order to gear more towards behavior
    - emotions are complex, so any categorical or dimensional approaches fail to account for all the nuances

- Adynamia is a lack of modulation of emotions
- Anhedonia is a loss of feelings of pleasures, from things that are normally pleasurable
- Alexithymia is the difficulty in labelling emotional experiences
- Depression is a chronic sadness coupled with hopelessness, and anhedonia.
- Anxiety includes phobias, GAD, OCD, and PTSD, which have two dimensions
    - anxious apprehension (worry)
    - anxious arousal (panic)
- Empathy is the ability to understand someone else’s feelings
    - Psychopaths / sociopaths lack empathy

# Article - Neural Processing of dynamic facial expressions in psychopaths (Decety, Skelly)

- psychopaths show less activation of all emotions, not just fear
    - thus, psychopathy is not fear-deficit and affects empathy of other emotions
- psycho. show less activation in OFC and vsPFC, which access and regulate emotional expressions and reactions
- amygdala responses towards facial expressions were not sig. diff. between control and psycho, but psych. had *less* activation in frontal regions
