# Aging

- We can use animals to model aging (because they live shorter lifespans) and dementia
- Transgenic animals are genetically modified to express (under/over) for a given protein
- Senile dog performance is much more error-prone on higher order cognitive tasks, and those task performances decline with age - but perceptual tasks are stable across age.
- Beta-amyloid protein buildup is present in aging canine brains, and this protein load is related to cognitive decline

- Seneca (Roman) said that embryos are mini people (no ... )
    - and claims that mini horses are seen in horse semen (no ...)
    - embryos are quite similar across species

- Sulci/Gryi don’t start forming until 7 months in
- Neural Maturation
    - axons grow faster (mm per day) than dendrites (microm per day)
        - which might mean axons are key to dendritic differentiation
    - dendritic arborization is the growth of dendritic spines
- Cell Death & Pruning
    - Apoptosis is a programmed cell dead
        - it is seen heavily in pruning, which culls unnecessary connections
        - at max, we lose 100k synapses a second
    - neurons rely on target neurons for survival, as neurotrophin keeps them alive
    - cell deaths work with reinforced learning , as reinforcing functional circuits leads to synaptic pruning of non-functional circuits (Hebbian learning)

- Myelination
    - adult functions of the brain only occur once neurons are myelinated, and this process goes until 18 - 21 years, as different regions myelinate at different rates, and the association cortices are usually last.

- Critical Periods
    - are developmental periods for which the brain is sensitive to certain stimuli, and deprivation can lead to permanent behaviour impairment
    - imprinting is when social interactions during critical periods are restricted to specific beings, usually within the same species.

- There is a clear difference in neurons in rats that are reared in a lab setting vs. a home (complex) setting

- Piaget created the 4 major stages of cognitive development
    - Sensorimotor (18 - 24 months)
        - object permanence (about 9 months)
    - Pre-operational (2 - 6 years)
    - Concrete operational (7 - 11 years)
        - Conservation (some properties remain unchanged despite changes in others)
    - Formal operational (12+ years)
        - higher capacity for abstract reasoning

- Down’s Syndrome
    - genetic abnormality - a doubling of the 21st chromosome
        - short stature, facial features, heart defects, spectrum of mental impairment
        - Alzheimer’s is inevitable

- Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)
    - abnormal physical features
    - smaller brains, abnormal gyral patterns
    - learning disabilities, mental impairment, hyperactivity
    - syndrome comes from alcoholic mothers, while signs happen from mothers who drink at critical preg. periods (1st trimester)
    
- Cerebral Palsy
    - anoxia (hypoxia) lack of oxy. to brain
    - affects motor function (limb spasticity, dyskenesias)
        - spasticity can be treated with botox
    - high risk of mental impairment
    
- Autism
    - abnormal social and language development (poor eye contact and attachment)
    - vocalizations, motor movements
        - stimming
    - spectrum of impairment
        - asperger’s (mild)
        - savantism
    - idiopathic (unknown cause)

- Models of normal aging
    - Resource Models
        - general decline in all functions and slowing of responses
    - Specific Deficit models
        - loss of inhibitory control
    - increased variability
        - the averages in performance of young vs. old are similar, but there is higher variability in older
    - nuns carried a lot of neuropathic indicators of Alzheimer’s, but had no explicit signs of dementia
    - Linguistic density of essays in early 20s predicted who developed dementia

- Association Cortices
    - frontal, parietal, medial temporal are most affected. They are last to fully develop, but the first to decline
    - frontal cortices have the highest reduction in neural tissue, and when compromised, there is a decline in executive functions, prospective memory and source memory.
    - parietal cortices house complex visuospatial tasks and attention. Right parietal involvement is generally stronger than left, and is why right hemi is generally more affected by aging
    - temporal cortices mean that deterioration impedes memory tasks that require organization, like prospective and source memory

- Slowing Aging
    - physical exercise has some support as it increases cerebrovasular function
    - mental exercise has very little support as there is a lack of transfer
    - elders who walked/runned had improved efficiency in default and frontal-parietal networks compared to a group that did flex, toning and balance exercise.
        - exercising promotes neurogenesis and arborization
