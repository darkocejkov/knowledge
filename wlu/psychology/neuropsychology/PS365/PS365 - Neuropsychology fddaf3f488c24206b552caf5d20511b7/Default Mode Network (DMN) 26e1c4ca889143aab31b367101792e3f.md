# Default Mode Network (DMN)

- Evolutionary perspective is good for understanding why we evolved brain function and behaviour, and is thus why animal studies are useful
- Rat fMRIs show that DMN homologue (translation) exists, with similar areas of activation between rats, monkeys, and humans.
    - thus, the DMN is cross-species and serves a purpose, possibly to integrate sensory and affective information during rest and sleep, and is an important function.
- Early studies used fMRI in long blocks, comparing activation between rest and activity to stimuli
    - it was believed and hypothesized that the brain is “off” during these periods and that activation in rest between participants is random with no pattern

- Marcus Raichle however saw that there are consistencies between activation in:
    - posterior cingulate, precuneus, MPFC, and IP and FC on lateral surfaces
        - this is the **default mode network**
    - this saw support from some PET work, but does not show that the network works in *synchrony*
    - fMRI work can reliably show regions that change together and form networks, and can use that to establish the correlation or non-correlation

- Main regions for DMN are
    - posterior cingulate
    - medial PFC, (sometimes lateral)
    - frontal, temporal cortices

- Visual network
    - posterior occipital

- Central Executive network
    - DLPFC, inferior parietal

- Salience Network
    - anterior insular

- Function of DMN
    - something that is not attention OR executive control, requires stimulus-independent activation, and mind-wandering.

- Mind Wandering
    - practiced Working memory tasks vs. novel tasks in fMRI
    - report levels of mind-wandering after
    - DMN activity increased during practiced tasks compared to novel tasks
    - ‘thought probes’ of access
    - increased DMN activity associated with self-reported mind-wandering.

- DMN activity
    - deliberate vs. spontaneous
        - delib. activates executive networks, while spontaneous activates only DMN.
    - activates with autobiographical memory, imagine future tasks, and theory of mind.

- In contrast, early fMRI studies fail to show activation in hippocampus because it was active during rest, which is not useful in control, but we need to compare brain activity during non-memory tasks.
- the Precuneus is on the medial surface of the parietal, superior to the cingulate cortex. It is strongly connected to tempo-parietal junction, and has connections to other association areas.
    - involved in attention shifting, motor imagery, self-referential processing, episodic memory

- Boredom
    - participants that are bored will experiment, even sometimes self-shocking.
    - the ‘at rest’ is definitely not restful, as there is always brain activity
    - videos to induce boredom (folding laundry)
        - boredom conditions had similar DMN activation to at rest conditions and sustained attention conditions, but the interest condition did not activate DMN the same
        

- Disease models
    - comparison of brain activity between controls and schizos, with schizos showing hyperconnectivity or hyperactivity within DMN.
        - precuneus and mPFC connections are stronger in schizos
        - this is analogous to how schizos have a different seperation between internal and external processes, with the healthy separation being in the middle.
        - this makes the DMN and Central Executive network (CEN) no longer anti-correlated in schizophrenics.
            - which explains positive symptoms (passivity phenom, thought withdrawal, thought insertion)
            
    - DMN is downregulated in autism, but upregulated in depression
        - meaning that autism has lower self-reflection, while depressives have higher self-reflection
    - reduced metabolism and increase in amyloid deposits in precuneus in Alz’s patients result in cell atrophy

- Topology
    - examines activity as function of integration and segregation, a breakdown of the modularity assumption
    - simple tasks are more segregated, and complex tasks more integrated

# Article - Default Mode of brain function, brief history of evolving idea (Raichle, Snyder)

- previous assumptions were that brain activity is driven by momentary env. demands, and that activity increases in result of purely inserted tasks
- however, the problem is that some inserted tasks led to increases in activation, and the posterior cingulate and precuneus often decreased in activation following stimulus

- a remarkable correlation in activity across DMN regions across time and at rest
- thus, pure insertion is not true for fMRI, and the brain is still active during rest control conditions
- 60% to 80% of energy used by the brain is for default activity, with momentary demands having .5% to 1% of it.
- it is now important to separate “at rest” and “task” activity into “intrinsic” and “extrinsic”. We can view the intrinsic system with participants lying quietly in scanners.
