# Dementias

- syndromes involving loss of cognitive function, sometimes changes in personality, and interferes significantly with social or work
- there are stages to this decline
    - mild
        - has fine judgment, can live alone and maintain hygiene and work/social activities
    - moderate
        - independent living is hazardous
    - severe
        - requires constant supervision
    

- 3 varieties:
    - cortical
        - generalized (alzheimer’s, pick’s, creutzfeldt-jakob)
            - aphasias, apraxia, agnosia, memory issues
    - subcortical
        - parkinson’s, huntington’s disease
            - personality change, cognitive slowing, attention lapses
    - mixed-variety
        - vascular dementia, aids dementia
            - symptoms vary to those in between cortical and subcortical

- Alzheimer’s (most common)
    - huge memory impairment
    - deficits in language, visuospatial, abstract thinking, motor performance, judgment, emotional/personality changes
    - diffuse brain damage
    - early onset (before 65, rapid)
    - late onset (after 65, slow)
    - there exists no specific test for living people - can only diagnose on autopsy, but behavioural tests are 90% accurate
    - typical to have global anterograde amnesia, but patients can “mask” symptoms by being routine and in familiar environments
        - however, unlike amnesia, procedural knowledge is not spared and suggests more widespread degeneration
    - brain have neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques, which cause vascular damage and neuronal cell loss
        - later stages have an atrophied cortex, and the degree of tissue loss associated with severity of deficits
    - mild cognitive impairments are deficits greater than normal, but not as severe as dementias
    - early onset genes are mutations on chromosome 21 that code for any amyloid precursor proteins, which is why down syndrome is linked to alz.
    - late onset genes are mutations in ApoE, which clear amyloid plaques
    - factors like smoking, cardiovascular disease, and head injury increase risk. decreasing risk is having higher education, physical act., mentally challenging work
    - has no treatment or cure, but therapies target cholinergic system, which inhibit the action of acetylcholinesterase.

- Frontotemporal
    - earlier onset than Alz.
    - deficits in social-emotional functioning (impulsive, emotional outbursts, little insight)
    - stable in spatial cognition, higher-order motor programs
    - characterized by a thinning of frontal-temporal regions, but parietal regions are stable
    - Pick’s disease is when pale neurons are swollen within the cytoplasm. There may be a genetic component, but not yet confirmed.

- CJ’s disease (Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s) is a dementia that progresses rapidly and is transmitted by prions (which are highly transmissible, and have long incubations)
    - new variant appeared in UK/France in 1990s, and affected people < 40 years, mad-cow disease

- Parkinson’s
    - cell loss in *substantia nigra*, a major source of dopamine
    - motor impairments (tremors, slowness), cognitive deficits in tasks requiring frontal lobes (exec. function) emotional well being.
        - L-dopa is the standard treatment.

- Huntington’s
    - inherited, manifests around age 35 - 42
    - destruction of GABAergic neurons in the stratum
    - jerky, rapid and uncontrollable movements, a decline in cognitive function. A frontal lobe deficit.

- Mixed-Variety dementia
    - diffuse damage in both cortical and subcortical areas
    - vascular dementia from strokes, AIDS dementia (severity directly related to viral load of infection)

- Vegetative States
    - Coma - no evidence of awareness or communication
    - Vegetative state - Coma + Sleep/wake cycle
    - Minimally conscious - intermittent awareness
    - can test by asking patient to perform mental imagery tasks for brain activation

# Article - Memory for Unfamiliar faces differentiates mild cog. impairment from normal aging (Nguyen, Gillen, Dick)

- Alz’s patients show deficits in facial ID, but less is known for mild cognitive impairments (MCIs)
    - most investigations of markers of MCI and AD focus on learning and retention of verbal info, but there is no clinical neuroimaging or biological marker that predicts MCI → AD with certainty
- longitudinal study, retested every 6 years on facial recognition and word recognition tasks
    - AD < MCI < control for word recognition
    - (NEW) AD < MCI < NCs for face recognition
- low face recog. scores did not predict shift from MCI to AD after testing, but low scores associated more to sig. impairment.
