# Single Case Methodology

# Methodology

- Using one individual to study unique cognitive presentations
    - usually rare diseases/lesion types
    - evolved from a teaching tool
        - was common at La Salpetriere
    - Walter Langer (Office of Strategic Services) psychoanalyzed Hitler
        - not exactly the most true description of Hitler in terms of psychology
        - but did predict his suicide as being extremely plausible
- requires a definable *pathology,* a certain way to trace the impairment of behavior to the anatomy
    - historically has been done through autopsy, after death
- also requires rigorous testing
    - control methods:
        - control tasks (patient is their own control)
        - control patients (double dissociation)

# Historic Cases

- have led to large advances in understanding
- are not exactly rigorous for modern experimental studies
- Broca’s Tan
    - productive Aphasia
    - tested behavior before death
    - autopsy after death revealed areas of damage (now called Broca’s Area in the iFG)
    - Limitations
        - Tan had other damaged left-hemi’s areas (thru CAT scan)
- Brenda Milner’s H.M
    - severe memory impairments
    - portions of temporal lobes remove
        - because of medication-resistant epilepsy
    - Limitation
        - revisiting the damage, a significant amount of hippocampal tissue was present
- Phineas Gage
    - impairments in executive function/inhibition
        - clear damage in frontal lobes
    - Limitations
        - accounts of his behavioral changes are exaggerated

# Lesions & Degeneracy

- Improving Lesion studies through comparisons
    - very important to control and compare similarly impaired individuals and to their neurotypical controls
        - HOWEVER, if we assess individuals with similar lesions due to strokes, then we cannot for certain disqualify that the changes in function are due to the lesions, but rather to the pathology of strokes themselves.
    - it is much better to compare patients with damage in the same hemisphere, as they are much more useful comparisons
        - because the brain areas that are vulnerable to damage will be damaged in both groups, but the region that is specific to the functional impairment should have *selective* damage
    - Biological Degeneracy
        - “the ability of elements that are *structurally different* to perform the *same function* or yield the *same output*"
            - Pierre Flouren’s “equipotentiality”
        - Cognitive Degeneracy
            - multiple (degenerate) areas, each capable of performing the same function
                - ie. sufficient, but not necessary
            - this means that lesion-deficit models for modularity cannot clearly deduce that the lesioned area is NOT responsible, if there is no impairment observed in those degenerate regions as well.
            - ie. these functions exist in “plastic” circuits, distributed across the brain, and the brain can reconfigure itself following damaged
        - Functional Degeneracy Degrees:
            - functional segregation: function A occurs in area A
            - functional integration: interactions between two+ brain areas (a system) are *necessary* to produce a cog. function
            - functional degeneracy: degenerate *sets* of areas that are each sufficient, only intersection is necessary
                - examples:
                    - semantic comprehension of language (can be done through reading, or through auditory means)
                    - object recognition can be done through either global identifiers of the shape, OR through local, finer details
        - may exist in order to have a better recovery post-injury
        - is also used in “scaffold learning” in which multiple degenerate sets can be used to learn about things and complement that learning
    - fMRI standalone does not really help in determining the true nature of these degenerate systems
        - imaging captures only sufficient systems, and can miss the different modes of functional degeneracy; partially because not all degenerate circuits are online for a single task
    - Lesions + fMRI are great converging methods to help piece together the mystery of degenerate systems

- Systematic Approach to single-case studies
    - fMRI image normals to identify candidate areas of degenerate areas
    - find/induce lesions in each candidate areas
    - is there a deficit?
        - YES: the lesion area is necessary component
        - NO: there may be degeneracy, and add that area to the candidate areas of degeneracy
