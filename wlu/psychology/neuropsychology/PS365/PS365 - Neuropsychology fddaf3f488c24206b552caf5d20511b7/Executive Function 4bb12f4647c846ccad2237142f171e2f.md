# Executive Function

Why do animals play?

- behaviour of play is not entirely functionality
- play should be voluntary
- can be modified compared to normal occurrence in functional context
- performed repeatedly, but not invariantly
- should appear in healthy animals

- ie. play simulates loss of control and predictability, and helps develop executive function
    - arborization of PFC.

The Frontal Lobe is the “CEO” of the brain, as it plans, strategizes, makes decisions, prioritizes goals and direction

Phineas Gage was thought to be in control of himself, but he was still able to work and have relationships.

- however, despite Gage, research shows a strong association between frontal lobes and executive function
- as frontal cortex damage leads to dysexecutive syndrome
- 

Frontal Lobotomies were still happening in the 1950s, but was a last resort. The negative consequences were learnt by the 50s and 60s.

The frontal cortex is divided into 3 main parts:

- Primary Motor
- Pre-motor
- Prefrontal (PFC)
    - Executive function resides here
    - the PFC is further divided into:
        - Dorsolateral (DL)
        - Rostral (R)
        - Ventrolateral (VL)
        - Medial (M)
- frontal cortex continues developing, and finishes last, about in your 20s. in comparison to other primates, its disproportionally large in humans.

- The “Convolution” allows for more packing of surface area, and thus humans have higher ratios of frontal cortex to rest of the brain, than other animals
- The FC is myelinated later than other areas (the lighter areas are myelinated after brown areas)
- FC is interconnected with many other brain areas, which are critical for integrating and maintaining information into goal-directed behaviour, via the senses and wants and needs, etc.
- Long white-matter tract (like the IFO Fasciculus) connect the FC to other regions
    - however, there is no direct connection between V1 and FC.

- Executive functions are the following:
    - Abstract reasoning
    - Decision making
    - planning
    - multi-tasking
    - cognitive flexibility
    - attention
    - self-control
    - error correction
        - these functions require an inhibitory control, task switching, updating work memory, planning

- How can we measure complex? Like executive function
    - Stroop Test (Red)
    - Sequencing
    - Verbal Fluency
        - capacity of following rules, and generating ideas
        - “name as many animals going from small to large in 1 min”
            - FL patients show inertia, preservation, rule breaking, lack of strategy
    - Mental Flexibility
        - Winsconsin Card Sorting task
            - sort cards based on given rule, communicated through trial+error right+wrong.
                - after rule is learnt, the rule changes
            - FL patients show dissociation between knowing and performing rule

- Risk Taking
    - FL patients (frontal lesioned) show higher impulsivity, increased drug abuse, etc.

- Figure Copying (copying an image)
    - relies on planning and organizing behaviour, so FL patients show poor planning

- Concussions
    - 61% of NFL players have had a concussion
    - retired players have 5x normal rate of mild cognitive impairment
    - symptoms:
        - loss of conciousness
        - slow to recover, motor coordination/balance issues, blank look, disoriented,
    - has gForces of about 25.8, but go as high as 45g’s

- Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBIs) are common from accel/deceleration injuries
    - do not need to actually be hit
    - works through coup + contrecoup rebounds of motion
    - has *diffuse axonal shearing*
        - the OFC is particularly vulnerable in TBIs because of the eye-bone that may puncture the brain

- Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is a degenerative brain disease linked to multiple concussive events
    - characterized by enlarged ventricles, wider sulci, looks similar to frontal lobe lesion patients
    
- Utilization Behaviour (UB) patients feel compelled to use objects placed in front for designed purpose
    - somewhat bizarre - compulsive praying, stacking glasses, mirroring actions
    - may be caused because of mirror neurons
    
- mirror neurons are neurons that fire for action and observation of actions
    - they support skill acquisition
        - as experts show greater activation in dorsal pre-motor when watching the actions they are expert to

- Theory of Mind
    - is the ability to infer thoughts + feelings of others, which is something autistic people struggle with

# Article - Association of TV violence exposure with exec. function in young adult males (Hummer, Kronenberger, Wang)

- childhood exposure to violence on TV predicts adult aggression
    - perhaps thru imitation and observation, desensitization
    - it is a poor cognitive control and inhibition of executive functions
    - some work shows that there is reduced activity and more structural abnormalities in PFC
- uses past/current TV diaries
    - measures using Stroop, Counting Interference Test, Digit Span, Connors’ Continuous Performance Test, Kaufman brief Int. test
    - MRI scans
    
- there is a negative correlation between attention-inhibition tasks and TV violence exposure (as TV violence goes up, attention inhibition goes down)
- no relation between TV violence exposure during past week and working memory performance
- inverse relationship between TV violence (up) and white matter volume (down), and this is strongest in cluster from R parietal to frontal lobe
    - no link for gray matter
    
- TV violence is then linked with poorer inhibition, increased impulsivity, lower cognitive control
    - cannot be certain is those with these characteristics are more drawn to TV violence, or if the violence causes changes in executive function
