# Language

- Gesture existed before language, as symbolic representation is a necessary condition for language

- Broca’s aphasia
    - deficits co-occur due to large lesions and damage, as the regions are anatomically close
        - inferior frontal, anterior superior temporal, insular cortex
    - not a simple speech production problem
        - deficits in production, phonology, syntax
            - with each depending on independent, but related functions found in highly interconnected and proximal regions
    - paucity of output (little speech), telegraphic speech (2-word speech “i hungry”)
    
- Wernicke’s aphasia
    - disruption of speech comprehension
        - can speak, but is nonsensical “word salad”
    - paraphasia is the substitution of inappropriate words within sentences
    - types of errors
        - semantic paraphasia
            - similar meaning “butter toast with spoon”
        - phonemic paraphasia
            - similar sound “took the pus to school”
        - neologisms (plausible non-words)
            - “galump”, “avarment”

- Conduction aphasia
    - disconnection syndrome, damage to the **arcuate fasciculus**
    - speech output is fine as Broca’s is intact, and comprehension is fine, but the ability to repeat something just heard is lost, as the sound image of Wernicke’s can not transfer to the output of Broca’s

- Lichtheim’s Model
    - Transcortical Motor
        - similar to Broca’s, but can repeat, and even show *echolalia*
            - “do you want a cookie” → “cookie”
        - lesion in left premotor cortex
    - Transcortical Sensory
        - similar to Wernicke’s, but can repeat, and show echolalia
            - lesion in left posterior temporal cortex

- Detecting Alzheimer’s
    - through the cookie jar test
        - the ability to interpret a scene with words. impairment looks like missing auxiliary verbs, articles and punctuation. even severer impairment means misspellings, missing subjects.

- Big questions:
    - does language require only 3 brain regions
    - is there language lateralization?
    - can language function be characterized only as production and comprehension? where does tone and prosody come in? what about phonology, syntax, semantics, are these better break downs of language function?

- Phonology are the sounds that compose language, are the rules of combining sounds together
- Syntax are the rules of the grammar
- Semantics are the meanings of words in the language
- Phonemes are the smallest units of sounds that signal meaning
- Phonetics are the context dependent sound productions
    - pill vs. spill (/p/ is different in both)
    - correct production of different phonetics is disrupted in Broca’s but not Wernicke’s
    - Places of articulation
        - Labial (lips)
            - /b/, or /p/
        - Alveolar (front teeth)
            - /d/ or /t/
        - Velar (soft palate)
            - /g/ or /k/
    - Voicing
        - voiced (release of air+vibration when vocal cords coincide) (/b/ or /d/)
        - unvoiced (non-coincident release of air) (/p/ /t/)
            - main difference is around 40msec, so timing is very important
    
    - errors occur for fluent (Wernickes) and nonfluent (Broca’s)
        - aphasic errors are most likely for sounds that differ in only ONE dimension (place of articulation OR voicing)
        - neologisms are errors that respect half the rules of phonology

- Syntax
    - subject - verb- object
        - “the CAT CHASED the MOUSE”
    - slip of the tongue errors are respecting of the syntax
        - “the boy BOAT the ball” is unlikely because a verb is replaced with a noun, but “the boy caught the BOAT” is more likely, as a noun replaces a noun
        
    - Broca’s an error of syntax?
        - telegraphic, agrammatical speech
        - difficulty understanding syntax-based sentences
        - but no problems understanding sentences differentiated by semantics

- Semantics
    - Token test, needs comprehension of meaning to perform appropriate action sequence
        - “point to red, then to green”
    - deficits in semantic comprehension occurs across modalities (auditory AND written), and means there’s a disrupted meaning system
    - Wernicke’s (posterior) aphasia is a deficit in semantics
    - however, the syntax impairment of Broca’s can impair the token test as the syntax is not understood, but they can use the correct objects.

- Written language
    - Alexia is the inability to read
    - Agraphia is the inability to write
        - they can be dissociated from each other, and from aphasia (which are usually coexisting)
    
    - Dual-route model of Reading
        - Direct route from visual lexicon to semantic system
        - Indirect route from visual analysis to semantic system by the grapheme-phoneme conversion rule
            
            ![Untitled](repo/wlu/psychology/neuropsychology/PS365/PS365%20-%20Neuropsychology%20fddaf3f488c24206b552caf5d20511b7/Language%20dfbfee178f044cdcb6e7adee0f3b65ba/Untitled%201.png)
            
    
    - Direct route vs. Phonological
        - associate sound patterns to meaning (phonological, indirect)
        - Grapheme to Phoneme correspondence rules, where the same letters can have different graphemic representations of the same phoneme
        
        - associate written form directly with meaning (direct route, semantic)
            - there exists irregular words such “colonel” and “yacht”
        
- Dyslexia subtypes
    - Phonological
        - can’t read non-words or unfamiliar words, but no problems with familiar regular+irregular words (85 - 95% correct)
        - mild impact on life, may reflect dysfunction of indirect reading, can happen through left temporo-parietal junction
    - Surface
        - cannot link visual information to meaning
        - disruption to direct reading route, cannot read irregular words but no problems with regular and non-words.
        - often confuses homophones (pain vs. pane) often have to sound out words, and have phonologically correct spelling (kernol → colonel)
        - often through dmg in L temporal cortex

- Big questions
    - why is language left lateral?
        - perhaps through praxis - the fact that gestures contain meaning, and that most population is R handed.
    - is there R hemisphere language role?

- right hemisphere language
    - split-brain patients show that R hemi contributes to language
        - but, they have poor syntax understanding, low speech output, poor phonological information processing, and have restricted vocabs to concrete words
    - the R hemi is specialized for language that is NOT processed well by the left hemisphere
        - prosody/tone
            - emotional tone, and syntactical information such as inflections
        - narrative (plot following)
        - inference (filling in the blanks)
    
- Prosody
    - the perception and comprehension is in the Right hemi’s Wernicke’s
    - but the production happens in the R hemi’s Broca’s
        - lesions in R posterior Wernicke lead to difficulty differentiating between statements and questions, and L lesion patients CAN do this
        - frontal lesions of Broca’s lead to aprosodic speech

- Inference + Narrative
    - narrative context is for text comprehension and following along the plot and characters
    - those with R hemi dmg have difficulty in integrating heard or written text, because they make inferences based on incomplete information while following the “thread” of a story, and deficits in understanding non-literal aspects such as metaphors.
    - These functions are used to understand if details are relevant to the gist by using theme information to understand those details
    - inferences are made on incomplete information, and the lack of inference means you cannot fill in the gaps.
    - so, that means there is a difficult in understanding metaphors, jokes, or indirect requests as they are inferential and non-literal.
        - however, these deficits are mild in comparison

# Article - Chinese Language and music dissociation with tumor in Broca’s (Zhang, Lu, Wu, Yao)

- how does language and music intersect in the brain? do intraoperative stimulation mappings help fMRI data on this question?
- a 19 y.o with a tumor, trained singer and piano musician. Chinese language is unaffected but music is affected by the tumor, with both measured before and after surgery.
- language and music activation mainly in left-middle frontal gyrus, and there is no overlap.
- music capabilities recovered at 3 months.
- shows that ISM and fMRI data converge, and that music and language have non-overlapping activation.
