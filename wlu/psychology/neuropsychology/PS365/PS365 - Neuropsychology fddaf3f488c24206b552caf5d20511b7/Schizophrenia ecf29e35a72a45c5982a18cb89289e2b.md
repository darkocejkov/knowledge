# Schizophrenia

- is a large group of disorders, seen by characteristic disturbance in language, communication, thought, perception, affect, and behaviour lasting longer than 6 months

- Dementia Praecox, initially by Morel (1857), and popularized by Kreaplin. It emphasizes a progressive deterioration in patients.
- Eugene Bleuler coined Schizophrenia, and noted that not all cases are due to deterioration, and is characteristic of psychotic epsiodes.
- DSM5 categorizes it as 2+ of the following
    - delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized/catatonic behaviour, negative symptoms
    - and social/occupational dysfunction, continous for at least 6 months, and excludes anything caused from medical or drug relation
    
- 1% of population approx., more common to those born in winter, and greater among lower socioeconomic classes, with the age of onset being young (male 18-25, female 26-40)
- negative symptoms
    - flattened affect
    - alogia (speechless)
    - depression, neurocognitive deficits, avolition (total loss of motiviation)
- positive symptoms
    - hallucinatic
    - disorganized speech
    - delusions
    - disorganized behaviour
- most suffer from lack of insight and blunted affect, suspiciousness and suspicious thoughts are less common, but result in diagnosis of schizophrenia

- neuropsychological deficits
    - originally focused on left temporal and frontal cortices based on auditory hallucinations
    - there are many general and widespread deficits, with the largest being in verbal memory, bilateral motor skill, performance IQ, WCST, memory, attention, language.
        - which suggests comprisation to different degrees in large portions of schizos.
    - there is a continuum of decline, some mildly decline, and some severe.
    - typically experience a first episode in the teenage years, as the expression happens when late myelinated areas come together

- paranoid schizophrenia
    - acute onset
    - auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions
    - most responsive to anti-psycho drugs, and has a relatively intact intelligence
    - typically guarded, tense, potentially aggressive

- simple schizophrenia
    - has a gradual onset, and there are predominantly negative symptoms (antisocial, avolition, flattened affect)

- disorganized schizophrenia
    - gradual onset, inappropriate affect, pronounced thought disorder, poor contact with reality, most severe

- catatonic schizo.
    - acute onset in adolescence, with catatonic motor symptoms, coupled with underlying thought disorder and delusion
        - motor symptoms like stupor, rigiditiy, mutism

- idiopathology
    - causes are uncertain, with a suspect in genetics but not certain. can come from complications during baby delivery and in winter months
    - many differences in anatomy like enlarged ventricles

- genetics
    - monozygotic twins do not have same indidence rate of schizo, which suggests that it is environmental, but having relatives with schizophrenia is a risk.
    
- anatomical differences
    - enlarged ventricles
    - total brain volume is smaller, and thus less gray matter in association cortices
    - overall hypometabolism, and in particular, hypofrontality

- the dopamine hypothesis
    - excessive DA activity or responsiveness to DA in mesolimbic/mesocortical DA system
        - the NA (nucleus accumbens) and parts of amygdala that affect and mediate memory, learning, affect, and thought organization
    - may be due to a gating mechanism for the consciousness, as stimuli is not filtered/gated properly and leads to overflow of information, and thus misattribution of sources
    - anti-psychotics block DA receptors
    - autopsies reveal more D2 and D4 receptors
    - psychosis from amphetamine resembles schizophrenia, and amphet. increases total DA levels, and amphet. makes schizophrenia worse
    
    - HOWEVER, antipsychotics treat mostly positive symptoms, and not negative
        - blocking DA receptors rapidly through antipsychos means a remission of symptoms occurs gradually over weeks
        - the enlargement of ventricles and grey matter loss indicates additional pathology
        - does not account for lower prefrontal DA activity
        
    - but, is there a stimulus independent release of Dopamine (DA)?
    - what about unpredictable triggers?
    
- functional connectivity
    - disruption of connectivity between frontal and temporal regions may be the cause of disorganized thought
    - abnormal EEG synchrony and abnormal white matter connections may explain hallucinations
        - this represents a different separation of internal vs. external mental contents than in controls

# Article - Exploring neural correlates of delusions of reference (Menon, Schmitz, Anderson)

- delusions of reference are when schizos believe unrelated stimuli are about them, like tv, radio, movies, etc. as if the objects were arrange to convey special meaning to them
- a hyperdopaminergic state is a release of stimulus-independent DA
- aberrant salience is the increased personal relevance assigned to neutral stimuli, triggers are unpredictable
- interest regions are cortical midline
    - ACC, precuneus, mPFC , vPFC and dPFC
- tests on delusions about ambiguous statements, with control sentences about the patients themselves
- looking at any personally salient recurrent concepts about the patientâ€™s lives

- patients described more items were about themselves, and personally endorsed items activated CMS
- there is a correlation between activation and delusion severity
- suggests inaccurate source attribution in schizo.
