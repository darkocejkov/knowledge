# Memory

# Lecture A

- Animal Memory
    - “the memory of a goldfish” expression, since goldfish have about 3s of working memory
    - However, some species of fish such as the African Cichlids can recall food location for up to 12 days
    - blue whales have extraordinary long-term memory
        - since they need to travel really far and long distances, and cannot use local/proximate cues to predict food in their environments
        - they also track the changes across seasons and years.
    - researches created artifical controls using simulations that moved only in response to local water temperatures
        - they saw a large difference in travel patterns between any two simulations and whales
            - which suggests that whales integrate more than immediate local information into navigation patterns
        - real whales significantly outperformed any simulations in terms of predicting *bloom* locations when they occur
            - memory then serves to suitable action in this case, as it helps whales to remember and find good opportunities to feed (ie. survive)

- Beliefs about Memory
    - Lots of groups believe that memory holds all experiences permanently, even if they cannot be accessed
    - There is a mixup in belief that people who commit crimes sometimes don’t remember the crime
    - quite  a few groups agree (except attorneys) that people with amnesia can’t recall their name or identity
    - Early views on memory include:
        - Ebbinghaus forgetting curve
            - where you forget about 70% of information within the first 5 hours, and retain the other 30%, slowly forgetting over the first 15 hours.
        - Serial Position effect
            - memory of information depends on the sequence of information, we commonly remember the first and last items in series, with more difficulty remembering the middle items.
        - Primary Memory
            - includes the memory of information that is currently within conscious awareness
        - Secondary Memory
            - information that was previously absent from consciousness that is put back into consciousness
                - which requires an active cognitive process to do so
        - Broadbent’s model, that information flows through different filter
        - Immediate/Primary Memory (RAM)
            - is a combination of two systems:
                - 1) pre-attentive memory store, a sensory “buffer”
                - 2) limited capacity store that makes up our conscious awareness
        - Secondary memory (storage)
            - permanent storage
        - memory was previoulsy thought to be composed of seperate systems, that are both functional and anatomical
        - short-term memory is of a limited capacity
            - which has a short lifespan (seconds to minutes)
        - specific processes must occur for memory to be consolidated from short-term, into long-term
            - long-term memory has a lifespan of storage for longer periods of time (minutes to years)
        - learning can then be defined as changes to behavior or in the nervous system (like synaptic connections and weight) that are made through experience itself
        - Types of memory
            - Long Term
                - Declarative (explicit)
                    - Events (episodic)
                        - experiences from times and places
                    - Facts (semantic)
                        - World Knowledge, objects, language, concepts
                - Non-declarative
                    - Procedural
                        - skills (motor + cognitive)
                    - Perceptual representation
                        - perceptual priming
                    - Classical conditioning
                        - conditioned responses between two stimuli
                    - non-associative learning
                        - habituation sensitization
            - Short Term

- Conditioning
    - Classical/Pavlovian Conditioning
        - learning the relationship between stimuli and the optimal response
            - famously, Pavlov’s dog to salivate to tones that are associated to food
            - unconditional response (UR) (reflex, with no association to secondary stimulus)
            - unconditioned stimulus (US) (produces the UR)
            - conditional stimulus (CS) (arbitrary stimulus paired close in time with the US)
            - conditioned response (CR) (response to the CS, without the US)
    - Instrumental/Operant conditioning
        - stimulus-response using:
            - reinforcing stimuli
                - postively enforcing
            - punishing stimuli
                - negatively enforcing
        - re-enforcement occurs after response
            - learning through doing (good vs. bad)
            - button → reinforcement (food) = more button presses
            - button → punishment (shock) = less button presses
                - uncertainty in the schedule produces stronger effects
    - Extinction
        - effects of conditioning can transfer to other objects
            - which is why extinguishing is important
        - conditioned *negative* responses can be extinguished by exposure to the conditioned stimulus with *no negative outcome*
        - when recall occurs, reminding people of the extinction itself makes the effect of extinction greater.

- New Models of memory
    - encoding → storage → retrieval
        - as to acquisition → consolidation
    - sensory input → sensory register → short-term storage (+ attention) → long-term storage (+ rehearsal/repetition) → long-term → long-term → ...
    - Monkey Memory experiment
        - delayed match-to-sample, monkey must learn that food is where the cue was NOT
        - in regions of prefrontal cortex, neurons relevant to what monkey needs to remember *continue firing* during the delay.
    - Short-term/working memory
        - after attention filters information, short-term memory stores small amounts of information prior to its long-term consolidation
        - working for seconds to minutes
        - popularly, 7 $\pm$ 2 is the capacity limit of short-term memory, that is true for different types of information (Miller)
    - Mnemonics
        - short-hands and strategies for remembering many different things, often by grouping discrete pieces of information
            - memory palaces, utilizing spatial memory to encode different objects
    - Short-term memory and forgetting
        - decay theory, that memory fades with time unless rehearsed
            - forgetting curve
        - interference theory, that memory for new material can interfere with information that we try to remember
        - Serial Position Effect
            - works through primary (first) and recency (last) in lists of information
            - recency depends on the fact that items at the end are still in STM
                - since distractor tasks at the end of lists interferes with recency, but not primacy
            - primacy depends on rehearsal
                - rehearsal is what consolidates information from STM → LTM
                - memory can begin transfering items at the beginning of a list to LTM when it has enough resources to do so
                    - faster presentation times fuck with the primacy effect
    - Baddeley and Hitch Working Memory Model
        - Phonological loop maintains and manipulates auditory information, including non-auditory information
        - Visuospatial Sketchpad, represents visual information, that does not interfere with the phonological
        - Central Executive determines which store to use

        - Episodic Buffer
            - this system is greatly aided by a secondary memory system that helps filter information based on the use of episodic long-term memory, language, and visual semantics.
                - the cognition of memory helps to consolidate and remember things if we have experienced them before, or if the information makes sense to us based on our knowledge of language and visual semantics (objects, scenes, etc).

# Lecture B

- Declarative Memory
    - knowledge that we have *conscious* access to
    - Episodic
        - personal experiences, the “autobiographical memory”
    - Semantic
        - Conceptual knowledge, the facts and semantics of information, where places are, who someone is, etc.
- Nondeclarative memory
    - the passive/implicit knowledge of how to do things, are our conditioned responses to things
        - riding a bike, the conditioned reponse of associated the bell to the food.
    - priming is the alteration of responses to a stimulus as a result of a prior experience of it
    - Perceptual Learning
        - “curse of knowledge”, once you learn something you don’t understand anymore what it’s like to not know it.
        - as seen in experiments that show degraded/fuzzy images over multiple presentations
            - participants recognize objects earler in subsequent presentations
            - and as a result, we see less Fusiform Gyrus activiation on subsequent presentations
                - less activation = greater recognition

- Amnesia
    - retrograde
        - loss of memories prior to injury
    - anterograde
        - inability to make new memoryies after injury
    - post-traumatic
        - transient period of anterograde amnesia
    - patient HM
        - had a bilateral removal of the medial temporal lobes
        - which resulted in awful anterograde amnesia
            - so he cannot form new memories, but could access old memories and use them
        - Milner (1957) discovered that HM had ‘graded amnesia’, meaning that not all of his past memories were lost. remote experiences like his childhood remained intact.
        - also, different forms/types of memories were intact
            - semantic, language, social skills, perceptual+motor, procedural
        - this suggests that there exist areas that are not the hippocampus that were sufficient for LTM
    - HM and procedural learning
        - asked to trace a star image by using his mirror reflection only
        - HM was able to improve with practice, meaning he was able to learn (and remember) how to do it.
    - HM’s damage
        - hippocampus removed, damage to entorhinal/perirhinal cortex, amygdala
        - revealed that the hippocampus is only a part of a memory *network*
        - remembering deals with the act of “re-constructing”, which (like in genetics), can be susceptible to mutation/errors
        - older memories are then more robust, because they depend less on the hippocampus
    - Korsakoff’s Amnesia
        - severe anterograde amnesia, temporally graded retrograde amnesia
        - seen in alcoholics
        - anatomically seen through sulcal widening, enlarged ventricles, damage to mamillary bodies
        - those with Korsakoff amnesia have a much steeper decline of timed memories than medial-temporal lateral amnesiacs
            - meaning that they remember much less the further away
        - Confabulation
            - happens in korsakoff amnesiacs, which is an attempt at creating false memories, without the attempt to lie/deceive (ie. they really believe these memories happened)
            - this is a way to make up information to hide their deficit, and is indicative of lack of awareness of the memory deficit that involves the frontal lobes.

- Memory Neuroimaging
    - retrieval of episodic memories activated the RIGHT but not left hemisphere structures
        - primarily the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
    - the LEFT hemisphere is involved in ENCODING of EPISODES and plays a role in retrieving semantic information
    - hemispheric encoding retrival asymmetry (HERA)
        - there is a reduction in asymmetry in seniors, as they age

- Forgetting Neuroimaging
    - evidence away from the “all or nothing” of memory. forgetten stimuli still produces activation at a lower level than remembered stimuli
    - posterior left inferior gyrus for words
    - right frontal for photos
    - there is a “tip of the tongue” phenomenon that occurs in the activation of the brain

- Memory and Imagery
    - no difference in brain activity between generating mental images vs. viewing real images
    - task: words remembered by associations with either pictures OR sounds
        - at retrieval, occipital cortex active for words associated with images,
        - auditory cortex active for words associated with sounds
        - overall: memory is a *recreation* process, meaning similar neural networks engage at both encoding and recall stages of memory

- Memory and Morphology
    - before GPS, it was seen that cab drivers had larger posetior hippocampi compared to non-cab drivers (because they had to memorize all street names)
    - even on a spectrum, more experienced cabbies had larger hippocmapi
    - memory thus can change morphology, that leads to a string memory, as there is more synaptogenesis

# Article

**Working memory of Dysfunction in Delusional Disorders: An fMRI investigation**

---

→ Working memory is a foundational cognitive *skill*

→ Delusional disorders are those in which non-bizzare delusions occur, in which no hallucinations occur, but have disorganized thought and behaviors. this may impair executive functions

→ working memory is then a core function on executive functions are built on.

Delusions:

- Bizzare
    - clearly implausible, not understandable. not derivced from ordinary life experience
- non-Bizzare
    - conceivable in everyday life (being followed, poisoned, fraud, etc.)
- Subtypes:
    - erotomanic
        - someone is in love with you
    - grandiose
        - great, unrecognised talent
    - jealous
        - unfaithful partner
    - persecutory
        - victim of conspiracy
    - somatic
        - emitting a foul odor

Methods

- 2 groups, deluded (9) and controls (9)
- block-design: 0-back task, 2-back task w/ fMRI
- 0-back is the baseline

Results 

- delusional group is less accurate and had more errors across both n-back tasks
    - meaning there is an impairment of working memory
- control groups had increased neural activity of the LEFT superior frontal gyrus
    - specifically, left DLPFC and right precuneus
- neural activity more prominant in delusion group compared to controls in left/right STG, LM/ITG, L/RFG, R/LPCG, RAmygdala

Discussion

- in Schizos, less pre-frontal activation during working memory and exec. function tasks
- in this study, less activation in L(DLPFC) in the delusion patients, meaning that delusions and schizo. are on the same spectrum
- both DD and schizophrenia arise from disfunction in regulating thoughts (disorders in exec. functioning)
- DD also showed greater activation in emotional circuits of the cingulate gyrus and amydala
    - which implicates the limbic system in the delusional disorder
