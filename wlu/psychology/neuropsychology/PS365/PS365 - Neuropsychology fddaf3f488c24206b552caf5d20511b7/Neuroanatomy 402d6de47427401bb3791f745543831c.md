# Navigational & Basic Terms

- How we navigate areas of the brain
    - Directions:
        - Lateral vs. Medial (Outside vs. Inside)
        - Anterior vs. Posterior (Towards the nose vs. Towards the back of the brain)
        - Superior vs. Inferior (IN RESPECT TO TWO THINGS, ie. one is “superior” to another, above)
        - Ventral vs. Dorsal (True directions of top bottom of the brain, towards the belly vs. top of the brain)
            - this comes from the early development of the brain - at first, the fore/mid/hind brain are along the same axis, but as the brain grows, they change.
            - the orientation of the compass for “dorsal” and “ventral” change when talking about the midbrain/forebrain vs. hindbrain/brain stem.
    - Planes:
        - Horizontal (Axial)
            - Bagel
        - Sagittal
            - Hotdog
        - Coronal
            - Bread
    - Relations:
        - Contralateral
            - OPPOSITE side ( L → R, R → L)
        - Ipsilateral
            - SAME side ( L → L, R → R)
        - Unilateral
            - SINGLE side only
        - Bilateral
            - BOTH sides
        - Proximal
            - CLOSE to the body
        - Distal
            - FURTHER away from the body

- Specific Areas of the Brain (Lobes of the Neocortex)
    - Frontal
        - Motor
    - Parietal
        - Touch
    - Temporal
        - Audition
    - Occipital
        - Vision
    - Some people also consider the *limbic lobe,* which is medial (inside).

- Types of *matter* of the Brain
    - Grey Matter
        - neurons, electrochemical transfers of information (dendrites, cell bodies)
    - White Matter
        - Glial cells (myelinated neurons)
            - “glue” cells
                - Astrocytes
                    - Surrond neurons and contact blood vessels - creates the BBB (Blood-Brain Barrier)
                - Olgiodendrocytes
                    - Serves to myelinate multiple axons in the CNS
                - Microglia
                    - removes dead cells from damaged neural tissues
                - Schwann Cells
                    - Myelinates single nerve cells in the PERIPHERAL NS.
        - Outnumbers gray matter 10:1

- Neurons & Function
    - Information arrives at dendrites (at synaptic terminals), from other neurons.
    - Chemicals and neurotransmitters accumulate in the cell body, and influence how likely this particular neuron is to “fire” an Action Potential.
    - The Cell Body contains all necessary organelles to keep the cell alive, and functional.
    - When a neuron fires, it uses the electrical properties of charged ions (mainly Cl-, K+, and Na-) to send a “message” down the Axon.
    - Myelin sheaths serve to “protect” the message and keep it alive, “boosting” the signal and power.
    - When Action Potentials arrive at the axon terminals, they enable those terminals to send other neurotransmitters and signals out to other connected neurons.
    - The “Resting Potential” of the neuron is about $-70mV$, which is created through the gradient of intra/extracellular fluids, and the concentration of ions.
        - Action Potentials are fired only when the neuron’s gradient changes through excitation, meaning that it’s potential raises above the “threshold of excitation” (about $-55mV$) - this happens when the neuron’s dendrites receive neurotransmitters that change the concentration of ions inside the cell body.
        - When an Action Potential fires, the potential switches polarity (depolarization), meaning that the inside of the cell has a more positive charge, and goes to about $+40mV$. After an action potential, this positive charge is short-lived, and the ion pumps work to make the cell negatively charged again.
        - Shortly after an AP, the cell goes above the resting potential for a short time (hyperpolarization), then levels out to resting again.
    - Neurotransmitters are the method that neighbouring neurons use to communicate to each-other, extracellularly. When an AP reaches the axon terminals, it allows small bubbles with neurotransmitter chemicals inside to escape the terminals, and bind to a neighbour neuron’s dendrites.
    - These neurotransmitter chemicals bind to the post-synaptic dendrites, and they enable ion channels to open and change the resting state of the neuron. Not all neurotransmitters bind however, because the post-synaptic dendrites must have the appropriate receptors for those neurotransmitters.
    - Different neurotransmitters have different effects on the resting potential of the neuron. They can either **excite** or **inhibit** action potentials.
        - Exciting signals *depolarize* the neuron, making it approach the threshold of action potentials, while Inhibiting signals make the potential more negative (polarized)
        - Inhibitory signals are more metabolically-intense, so there are more excitatory signals generally.
    - Afferent signals travel TOWARDS the CNS (from the body/limbs/eyes)
    - Efferent signals travel AWAY from the CNS (to the body/limbs/eyes)
    - Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) is a fluid that is a “cushion” for the brain, it resides in *ventricles* as a reservoir, but also lines the cortex of the brain. The purpose of CSF is to supply the brain with nutrients, a method of removing waste, and maintains the BBB.
        - It is created in the “Choiroid Plexus” and the Lateral/3rd Ventricles.
        - Hydrocephalus is from a blockage of the *ventricular system*, and is attributed by excess CSF. It may cause mental impairments in children, but sometimes does not damage neurons by fluid compression, and instead can just create headaches.

Why?

- So that we can understand why and how specific pathologies and diseases affect the brain
    - Parkinson’s is a dopamine deficiency
    - MS is when myelin sheaths are damaged
    - Epilepsy occurs through abnormal electrical activity.
    - etc.

The Cortex

- Made up of *gray matter*
    - Gyri (plural) are the “folds” or “mountains”, while the Sulci (plural) are the “valleys”.
    - Since every brain is unique, there are differences in the exact structures of cortical folds, however, there are commonalities between every brain in some gyri and sulci, because they are important functionally.
    - The amount of cortical folding is positively correlated with the intelligence of a species, not body/brain ratio or brain volume/size.
        - But, folding is not entirely the reason. The ratio of the FRONTAL brain to the rest of the brain is important.
    - Brodmann was a scientist that was responsible for mapping out the *cytoarchitecture* of the brain, the cellular composition of neurons. Each region of the brain has different cells associated with it. Something less apparent here is that the cortex has 6 layers (laminae), and the shape of cells and their sizes differs across brain regions.
        - These regions map pretty closely to the functional areas of the brain.

- The brain also has its own *cortical Maps* of the body in it
    - Cortical Topography “maps” functions of the brain onto specific regions
        - Hughlings Jackson was the first to notice that specific body parts were involved in specific seizures (Jacksonian March)
        - He also proposed the “map” of the body in the brain, called the “homunculus”. This representation is disproportionate, meaning that certain body parts have different proportions in the brain, such as the hands or the head.
        - Wilder Penfield used electrodes to stimulate brain regions to map out the *somatosensory cortex* (parietal), and we can see that the two cortices, motor and somatosensory have slightly different representations.
    - Motor strips cross contralaterally at the spinal cord, so the RIGHT side of the brain’s motor strip control’s the LEFT side of the body.
    - Ramachandran saw that phantom limb pains can be remapped to the face, causing phantom limb sensations in the face. This is because there is no AFFRENT signals from the hand, and the brain can remap its signal to another motor piece.

# Occipital Lobe

- the “visual” cortex
    
    ![https://www.perkins.org/wp-content/uploads/1970/01/the_brain_13.png](https://www.perkins.org/wp-content/uploads/1970/01/the_brain_13.png)
    
- the Visual Pathway is how information from the eyes arrives to the Occipital, and its stops on the way.
    - information from the retina to the brain via. **optic nerve**
    - half of those fibers cross at the **optic chiasm**, and pass the Optic Tract Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus
    - a secondary pathway exists that takes the signal from the Pulvinar Nucleus to the Superior Colliculus
    - after the LGN, the information continues along the Optic Radiations towards the visual cortices, and arrives at the *primary visual cortex* (V1) which is along the **calcarine fissure**
        - The LEFT visual field of each eye, arrives at the RIGHT hemisphere, and vice versa.
        - The UPPER visual field is processed by the BOTTOM of the calcarine sulcus (lingual gyrus), and the LOWER visual field is processed by the TOP of the calcarine sulcus, the cuneus.
        - CENTRAL vision processed POSTERIORALLY by the Occipital Pole, while PERIPHERAL vision by the anterior part of the Occipital.
- Half of the information in EACH eye is processed CONTRALATERALLY, while the other half IPSILATERALLY
- The processing of the visual field is marked by different areas of the occipital lobe, and the “target” represents areas of the visual field mapping to the brain. We can see that the upper vision (9,5,7,11,1,3) are all processed on the inferior regions, and vice versa. Central vision (1,3,2,4) is POSTERIOR, and vice versa.

- Luria (Russian scientist) described the Functional Hierarchies of human behavior, that human behavior can be seen as being made through building blocks of other behaviors.
    - If we translate this to visual perception, we can relate simpler properties earlier on in processing in the occipital cortex. First, it would be the simplest properties such as line orientations, spatial frequency, brightness.
    - Next, those basic properties are built on by other processing to continue to integrate simple stimuli into more complex representations
        - This is true of all sensory pathways.

# Parietal Lobe

- “Haptic Information” with the Somatosensory Cortex
    - Touch, temperature, kinematics,
- Super important for directing *spatial attention*
- Temporo-Parietal Junction (TPJ) is important for integrating information from multiple sensory modes, and combining internal states (intention, proprioception) with external information (directing eyes, hands, etc).
    - Called “goal-relevant” processing
    - LEFT and RIGHT TPJs have different roles, and damage to each has different effects.
        - LEFT TPJ damage means Apraxia (inability to perform gestures, complex movements)
        - RIGHT TPJ damage means Neglect (specifically to the left-world, behavior and sensory information is neglected, as if it no longer exists)

# Temporal Lobe

- Visual/Auditory sensation response center
- Language comprehension, semantics, memory (medial)
- Emotional Processing (limbic system)
- Object/Facial recognition
    - damage can lead to agnosia (objects) and prosopagnosia (facial)

# Frontal Lobe

- Smell/Taste sensations
    - these are entirely *ipsilateral*, they do not cross hemispheres
- Motor control
    - in the primary motor cortex (just anterior to the central sulcus that divided the frontal & parietal)
- Also involved in all complex sensations and behaviors
    - Executive control (planning, decision  making, judgement, social behaviors)
    - Damage to the frontal can lead to drastic but subtle changes in behavior like:
        - disorganized behavior, disinhibition, inappropriate social behavior, impaired abstract thinking, emotions, preservation, personality
    - Is not fully developed until late teens/early twenties.
