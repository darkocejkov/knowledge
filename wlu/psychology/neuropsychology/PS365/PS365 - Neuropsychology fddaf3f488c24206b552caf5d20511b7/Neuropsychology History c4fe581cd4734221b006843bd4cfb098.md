# Neuropsychology History

Edwin Smith Papyrus

- Ancient Egyptian text from 1600 BCE.
- Brain ailments and diseases
- Surgical brain procedures based on rationality, logic, and science rather than “magic”

Peruvian Trephination

- holes in the skull, to treat bleeding and swelling (Craniotomes)

**Plato**

- Brain is the source of the triumvatum of the soul

**Aristotle**

- Cardiac hypothesis
    - heart is the seat of the soul, not the brain.
    - the temperature of the heart is what is affected by emotions

**Hippocrates**

- recognized the contralateral organization of the brain (left controls right, etc).

**Galen**

- Gladitorial Physician
- Recognized contralateral organizations
- Performed dissections and vivisections on the brain

**Da Vinci**

- “Cortex” is the “bark” of the brain
    - cortex is the protection of the brain
- And the brain fluid (CSF) in the ventricles were what was being protected, the “psychic pneuma”.

- 3 Main vectricles by their functions:
    - Common Sense (imagination)
    - Cognition (reasoning, judgement)
    - Memory
    

<aside>
⭐ THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT CORRECT

However, this is a great example of how each generation gets a little close and closer, and uses more scientific reasoning.

</aside>

**Versalius**

- Revived Galen’s Work
- public dissections
- focused on the anatomy of the brain, rather than ventricles.
    - detailed drawings, shapes of the brain

**Descartes**

- the “pineal gland” as the principle seat of the soul, all thoughts are formed here
    - only humans have, animals do not
    - pineal gland is not bifurcated (it actually is)
- candle thought-experiment
    - mind-body problem
        - unlit candle: hard, cold, solid
        - lit candle: liquid, hot, fragrant
    - the vision and senses are not aligned with thinking and thought
    - “cogito ergo sum”
        - mind-body dualism

**Franz-Gall**

- phrenology
    - happened in ancient india 5000 years before.
- innate talents and personality are reflecting by different brain organs, that in turn shaped the skull
    - 27 in total, 8 unique to humans
    - a “pseudo-science”, but the underlying principle is that differences in brains produced differences in persons.
- informed Criminology
    - specific physical traits are associated towards specific crimes
- examined *individual differences*
- **Mark Twain**
    - tried to “de-bunk” by going in disguise
- Brought the “modularity of function” of the brain, many regions perform many functions
- Emperor Francis II (Austrian) went against Gall because that God is responsible for free-will, not the brain.

**Broca**

- looked after the patient called “Tan”, that had expressive aphasia, only could say a single syllable “Tan”.
    - “Broca’s Area”, the only region responsible for language (which is wrong)

**Wernicke**

- Found that patients with damage to post. stg. had language comprehension deficits, proving Broca wrong that Broca’s areas is the only region for language.
- “Wernicke’s Area”
    - Receptive Aphasia

**Flourens**

- Pigeon ablations
- suggestion of cerebral plasticity
    - Lashley revisits this in mice to show that small damage was not serious, but damage to many regions changed behavior and function a lot.
    - called “Mass Action”

**Brodmann**

- cytoarchitectonic map of the brain
    - 50 areas by differences in cell structure
    - similar to difference in functional organization

**Ramon y Cajal** & **Golgi**

- Founded the *Neuron Doctrine*
    - that the brain is composed of discrete cells called Neurons
        - not connected to each other
- Golgi is the one that invented the silver nitrate stain that shows the structures of the neurons
    - syncytium theory of the brain
        - a continuous mass of tissue, with ONE cytoplasm (all connected)

**Penfield**

- epilepsy patients during surgery
    - stimulated parts of their brains to see and ask what they experienced
- developed the motor+somatosensory homunculus

**Phineas Gage**

- before Gage, the frontal lobes were “silent”
    - not very active, the posterior is important  (NOT TRUE)

Lobotomies

- removing parts of the frontal lobes for psychiatric illness that were hard to therapy

**Hughlings-Jackson**

- higher functions
    - combinations of more basic activities make up the functional hierarchy

**Luria**

- 3 distinct functional units
    - brain stem: arousal
    - posterior cortices: reception, integration of sensory information
    - frontal cortices: planning + executive functions

Brain Imaging Technologies

- **Hounsfield** did the first CT images  (1967)
- MRI images (1973)
    - **Lauterbur**, **Mansfield**
- **Ogawa**: First BOLD images (1990), **Kwong** for first BOLD brain images.

## Weighing Brain Activity with the Balance (Mosso, 1935)

- a “balance board” of brain activity, if blood is required when doing something complex in the brain, it goes more to the brain
    - combines circulation and brain function, and a preliminary and primitive way to “image” brain function
- used Plethysmograph
    - measured pulsations in people with skull defects
        - transformed the pulses into waves, related to function
    - a proof in using blood to measure cognitive function

- the balance board had patients lying down, with weights and counterweights.
    - patient must be centered
- considered the influence of signal VERSUS noise (movements, breathing, etc.)
    - subtraction method
        - “rest period” of about an hour, and contrasted this with reading tasks, the difference is the cognitive complex part of the tasks
- Tested also emotional reactivity
    - reading a letter from a spouse, or creditor
    - balanced tipped all at once
