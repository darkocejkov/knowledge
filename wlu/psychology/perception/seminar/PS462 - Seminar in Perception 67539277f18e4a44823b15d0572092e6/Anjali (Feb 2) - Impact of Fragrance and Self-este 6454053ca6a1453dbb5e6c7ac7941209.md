# Anjali (Feb 2) - Impact of Fragrance and Self-esteem on Body Odors and the Impression of Others

# Questions

SIDENOTE @ THE BEGINNING:

- really enjoy the design and minimalism of your fonts and slides

→ So in a very simplified interaction:

- everybody emits body odors, almost like animals do pheremones
- and these body odors influence how other people interact with you

→ was there any auxillary research done about the influence of *bad* odors on social influence, rather than just good fragrances vs. no fragrance?

→ could a different cause for this effect be learned? for example, the association between fragrances and general experiences may influence the ‘taste’ of the individual in terms of preferred fragrance.

~~→ was there any detail on the *kinds* of fragrances that were used?~~ 

- ~~fragrances are kind of like wine, there are so many subtle things about fragrances, so i’m definitely wondering if there is some sort of difference in results depending on the fragrance the males wore.~~
- ~~for example, if males wore more traditionally masculine fragrances (wood, smoky aromas) compared to more feminine (soft, fruity) fragrances how that might change the responses of females in this hetero-normative format.~~

# Discussion

- honestly i never wear it because i’m lazy and i never go out but this presentation and study helps me understand the innate “first impressions” we each have about people and just how deep it goes.
- ~~how does everyone think that the result would change if they used more than just hetero participants, and broaded the question to attactiveness rather than dating?~~
- i also don’t necessarily think fragrances are harmful, because it gives an overall sense of polish to someone who wears it, and has other polished traits about them, but there is definitely a time and place to wear it.
- since this effect relies on sweat from self esteem groups being different, would it then be reasonable to think that high self-esteem people produce more chemicals that give their sweat a specific quality, like ‘sweet’ for example?
- becuse of this presentation i’m definitely going to go from never wearing cologne, to considering now.
- how could this translate to *groups* of people?
- what about fragrances that aren’t specifically perfumes for example, like from foods and other aromatic things, non-concentrated oils.
