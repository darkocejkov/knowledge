# Literature Review

# Assignment Specifications

---

- A review of past and current research that explores a specific topic of perception. The topic that I‚Äôve chosen is the:
    - Impact of auditory and/or tactile sensory information on the *perception of eye-gaze*

<aside>
üí° A good literature review touches on the following concepts about the topic of interest:

- A comprehensive background, explaining the current knowledge, composed with the primary methods used and any commonalities between research, the presence of debates in terms of conflicting information/alternate results, and examines any gaps that exist in the current knowledge to extrapolate any possible areas to conduct future research.
</aside>

- In order to properly communicate these concepts effectively, we need to:
    - properly cite sources and identify (clearly) the connection every source has to the topic.
    - analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the field and any research with respect to the research question
    - is well organized by introducing the Research Question (RQ), identifying any hypotheses that we have about previous hypotheses, and explaining the methods
- In essence, given the topic, we need to look for the best papers for that topic that contribute something large to that research question. We need to analyze each paper and connect each paper through critical analysis to the topic, provide critique and reasoning for that paper in context to other papers, and summarize important themes within and between papers.
- As well as giving proper background, almost like a ‚Äúgetting started with the topic‚Äù theme, where we summarize and explain the overarching themes that connect all papers to the topic, such as their hypotheses, methods, results, etc.

- Review article that covers 3 new findings:
    - Sound Alters Visual Temporal Resolution
        - which studies how sound manipulates visual information in terms of two closely-timed visual stimuli, asking the question, which comes first? the experiment uses audio in different conditions where each stimulus arrives discretely on its own, but the sequence of stimuli is changed
            - VV is the baseline condition, where only the two VISUAL stimuli were shown
            - AVVA represents an audio. presented both before and after
            - VAAV is two audios were presented in between visual
            - AVV / VVA
                - Temporal resolutions changed between conditions
                - AVVA > VV
                - VV > VAAV
                    - AVV and VVA had no significant differences from baseline, which shows that the differences are not due to cueing of attention

    - hypothesized that cross-modal cueing works for spatial position targets only when the modality supports an action that leads to improved sensory analysis (a saccade with the eyes is better than ‚Äúlistening more‚Äù?)
    - auditory AND visual cues sped response times up, but only for visual targets (not auditory ones)
- *Supramodal and modality-specific mechanisms for stimulus-driven shifts of auditory and visual attention.*
    - visual cues affects response time for both visual and auditory, whereas auditory cues only affect auditory target response times.
- Methods include some form of visual cues through some apparent screen (LEDs) with audio-producing speakers being on the lateral sides.
    - the importance of the methods here is that both modalities of sensation came from equal distances and angles - ie. on the same plane
- 4 blocks of trials:
    - visual-cue-visual
    - audio-cue-audio
    - visual-cue-audio
    - audio-cue-visual
- 6 different experiments

- drivers with HVFDs are allowed to drive in certain areas, but still pose a risk of not detecting hazardous situations due to their blindness
- vibro-tactile driver assistance displayed a marked improvement in detection of hazards, as they directed eye gaze through directed

- visual perception altered by both sound AND touch
    - even in early processing (V1 - primary visual cortex)
- references:
    - ventriloquist effect = location of sound captured by location of visual stimulus
    - mcgurk effect
    - multisensory enhancement has been seen to be more of a cognitive function rather than a perceptual one
        - like pairing beeps with lights, even though beeps don‚Äôt exactly provide any direct meaning to a light stimulus, we still perceive beeps paired directly with lights as brighter
            - this appears as a response bias
        - however, studies have shown that there are multisensory inputs (both informative and informative) can aid visual processing
            - which appears due to a priming/cueing function that
    - non-cueing sounds can aid visual perception
    - sound effects vision temporally
        - duration of visual stimuli affected by sound
        - perceived rate can be influenced by sound
        - the effect of auditory manipulation can have long-lasting durations even without the audio being present
            - ‚Äúcannot unhear/unsee‚Äù
        - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10718066/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10718066/)
    - multisensory inputs help to direct attention
        - 

## Connections between vision, tactile, and auditory sensory processing

### [The impact of multisensory integration and perceptual load in virtual reality settings on performance, workload and presence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84196-8) (2021)

- Understanding the connection between feeling multiple senses and the idea of feeling ‚Äúpresent‚Äù in a situation, even though the situation may not be real
- In perspective to a cognitive, perceived workload, multisensory stimulation decreases workload, but only in the visual+auditory+tactile conditions
    - which leads to a greater sense of presence
- trimodal condition lead to decreases in latency of response, P300 amplitude increases compared to unimodal conditions
    - suggests faster, more effective processing is occurring

# Review Breakdown

## Concrete Definitions

<aside>
üí° Eye Gaze

- Primary driver for visual information.
- 4 Basic types of eye-movements
    - [Types of Eye Movements and Their Functions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10991/)
- Eye gaze is highly important in non-verbal social interactions as it is a way to communicate attention, intention, emotion, etc. It also serves for turn-taking in social situations, as we can visually monitor conversations through visual cues.
    - [Affective Eye Contact](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01587/full)
    - [Eye Gaze in regulating Turn Taking](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.616471/full)
- We have very sociological functions stemming from eyes based on the information we can perceive from just a pair of eyes without additional context
    - [Role of Eye Gaze in Typical and Autistic People](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00560/full)
        - Such as understanding what people are looking at, and mechanics that involve precise timing of attention details
- Thus, eyes become primary to absorbing non-verbal cues in social situations as there are more cues for visual modalities rather than auditory or tactile cues.
- The gaze of the eyes is a massive proponent to visual spatial attention.
    - Lots of studies have undergone experimentation to understand how different modalities of sense affect vision perception, ie. what we see, but only a fraction of the number go on to analyze how this affects *eye-gaze* specifically.
    - Visual perception is not exactly the same as eye-gaze, as eye-gaze implies the temporal sense of sequences of gaze between points in time. Visual perception is more about the content we see and how we see it, but eye-gaze again, implies the intention of cognition for directing attention.
