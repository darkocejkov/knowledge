# Graphs

Simply put, graphs are a collection of **nodes** and **edges**. Nodes are arbitrary objects which connect to *other* nodes using ***edges.*** You can only connect nodes to other nodes.

The collection of nodes is called **V**, in which the number of nodes is $|V|$. The collection of edges is called **E,** in which the number of edges is $|E|.$ A graph is a collection of nodes AND edges, so $G= (V,E)$.

Graphs are very useful in representing information in problems and relations between different objects.

Edges can represent actions taken, and nodes can represent discrete *states* of objects.

For example, if these nodes were places, and edges were the roads between them, we could travel from 6 â†’ 4, but not from 6 â†’ 1 directly.

However, we could travel 6 â†’ 1, given that we would take:

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ 6 â†’ 4
4 â†’ 5 OR 4 â†’ 3
5 â†’ 1 OR 3 â†’ 2
      OR 2 â†’ 1

</aside>

â†’ these are **paths** or **walks** that we can take between nodes.

Graphs can be *directional*, meaning that edges are constrained to certain directions. We cannot travel between nodes that do not have the appropriate edge.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ if a â†’ b, but b !â†’ a,

</aside>

Likewise above, graphs can also be *undirectional*, meaning that edges are not directed and any edge indicates travelling both ways.

Similarly, edges can have *costs* or *weights* associated with taking the action.

Some nodes may possess edges to themselves.

# Representation

## Adjacency-List

Meant for *sparse graphs*, where $|E| << |V|$. These usually maintain graph using a list of *linked lists*, each of which contain references to connecting nodes, and perhaps the weight for edges between nodes.

## Adjacency-Matrix

Meant for *dense graphs*, that have many edges between nodes. It is an $n*n$ matrix, where *n* represents the number of nodes. Every cell of intersection between nodes indicates a possible edge. Values in these cells can represent different things based on the graph properties.

â†’ if graphs are unweighted, we can represent edges using 1's and 0's, otherwise the values can represent the weight of the edge, and if two nodes have no edge, $\infin$ can represent the lack of an edge.

Undirected graphs will possess symmetry of the matrix, because if a â†’ b, then b â†’ a. Digraphs may not be symmetrical.
