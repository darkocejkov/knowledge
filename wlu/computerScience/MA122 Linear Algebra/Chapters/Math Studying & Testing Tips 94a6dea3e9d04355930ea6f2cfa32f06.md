# Math Studying & Testing Tips

In general, math can be either heavily **theory** based, which makes it quite difficult to study for. You have to *really* understand the theory when it involves proofs to understand how to carry forward the ideas of math.

For example, this course (Linear Algebra) takes a lot of time to *prove* the theories that appear. These proofs are going to be really foreign to you if you've never seen the different types of proofs.

However, math tests are not all theory-based and "thinking" based. In highschool, our tests were divided into different sections (basic, application, thinking). Thinking questions were based on the theory, and entirely on the abstract concept. For example, a thinking question for this course would be something like "Given the fact that A is invertible, can we necessarily prove that it is diagonalizable?". These kinds of questions are quite difficult because they truly test how much you *know* about the concept of invertability.

Exam at WLU differ by professor (obviously), and we need to understand the types of exams we are going to be taking to succeed, right? So based on the first midterm, think about what kinds of questions were asked. There were 2 proofs, a couple MCQ's, and the rest were computation. 

Math is something that is not easy, but it doesn't need to be difficult. High-school math and other math courses are made arbitrarily difficult because not only do they care about the method you use, but your result and outcome. However, some profs definitely understand that the time-limit and the pressure is very difficult to avoid, and thus you will make mistakes that you wouldn't otherwise. 

That's why a core tip to doing university level math, is to focus on the knowledge and intuition of each formula and practice question. I always ask myself "how does this fit into the rest of the course", or how this question may be followed be another that asks me to continue the chain of problems. For example, you may be asked to find the determinant of a matrix, then the next question might ask "is the matrix invertible?". The core link here is to understand how the determinant is linked to the invertability of the matrix.

The easiest answer you might be looking for is this: never not attempt a problem. Remember, the less questions there are on the exam, the more each question weighs individually. I think everyone would rather take an exam in which there was 100 questions, each of 1 weight, versus an exam with 1 exteremely long, chain question. There are always part-marks to find.

Also, this exam is open-book, meaning that you can access your notes.

ðŸ’¡ Studying Facts

Based on lots of research in education, there are lots of studies that show evidence that taking your own notes and doing your own work will give you the highest retention of knowledge. Above this however, is actually teaching someone the concept. When you teach a concept to someone who doesn't know anything about it, you're forced to make the connections for yourself to even attempt to teach it to them.

I used to be really anxious about exams because it was difficult to recall every single piece of information that you're supposed to know. That's not how your brain works, unfortunately. Your brain requires *context*. You can't really just ask yourself a question randomly and expect to know the answer every time.

Don't get me wrong though, math is tough because there is a lot of bridges to connect, and understand WHY something is the way it is. If you're not willing to put in the effort to understand, then you won't succeed in math. No flame, just experience. I failed MA122 TWICE, MA121 once, and also MA103 once. I actually did my work, and not because I had to, because i needed to. 

Doing your homework and the problems might not be enough though, because everyone is different. Take this mind-map for example, it's for Discrete Math. I spent hours and hours revisiting concepts and drawing this all out to make myself believe that all these concepts are connection, both in theory and in visual.
