# 4 = Decidability

We’ve seen problems that are solvable, but not many that are totally *unsolvable*... What makes problems unsolvable, and how can we find out if a problem *can* be solved? IN this case, “solving” means an algorithmic solution, and not random guessing.

# 4.1 Decidable Languages

## Regular Decidability

- The **acceptance problem** for DFAs tests whether particular DFAs, given a string, can be expressed as a languages.
    - the language contains *encodings* of all DFAs together with the strings they accept
        - kind of like a master list of all DFAs that recognize some arbitrary string
    - $A_{DFA} = \{B,w\}$
        - where B is DFA that accepts some input *w*.
        - just like we can test whether B accepts *w*, we can test if <B,w> is a member of the master-list of DFAs.
            - thus, showing that a language is *decidable* is the same as showing that the problem itself is *decidable*.

- In fact, the language $A_{DFA}$ is decidable
    - to show that some language is decidable - some Turing Machine must represent it, and always halt.
        - so, to show that this language is decidable, we show that a Turing decider machine exists for it.
    - On the input <B, w> where B is a DFA, and *w* is an input string, the TM that decides must:
        - simulate B on the input of *w*
        - if the simulation ends in an accept, accept. Otherwise, reject.
            - in a way, we are the “Turing machines” that work to design and test DFAs by simulating DFAs for input.
    - So, when our Turing Machine receives some input, we first check to see if the DFA is formally correct through its components, otherwise we can automatically reject because the DFA is not correct.
    - The TM then simulates B by using its transition function and states with the input string, keeping track of the input DFA’s state and position on *w* by using the tape.

- Also, the language of $A_{NFA}$ is decidable
    - this proof is based on the last. Because we know that $A_{DFA}$ is decidable, we can use that and our knowledge of NFAs to show that $A_{NFA
    }$ is decidable.
        - Remember that NFAs are equivalent to DFAs, but we can only convert $NFA \rarr DFA$
        . Since we can do this, we can use the previous machine that simulates DFAs as a “subroutine”, after we convert the input NFA to a DFA.
        - Thus, if the converted DFA accepts, the NFA accepts, and vice versa.
        - So, we have shown that the language of NFAs is decidable.

- Since $A_{NFA}$ and $A_{DFA}$ are decidable, what about the language of regular expressions, $A_{REX}$? It is also decidable.
    - Since we can convert $REX \rarr NFA$, then it must be the case that $A_{REX}$ is also decidable.
        - And to show an algorithm for this, we can use the machine for $A_{NFA}$ as a subroutine for $A_{REX}$.
            - convert the input <R,w> where R is a regular expression into some equivalent NFA using the theorem
            - then run the Turing Machine constructed for $A_{NFA}$, which converts the NFA into a DFA, then simulates a DFA.
            - Thus, if this simulation accepts, then the overall machine accepts. Otherwise, it rejects.

- This decidability for the different models of computation, NFAs, DFAs, and REGEXs, means that these classes are **decidable**, meaning that we can always decide (yes, no) whether or not some given automata (NFA, DFA, REGEX) will accept or reject some arbitrary input string.
- Besides testing for decidability, we also have **emptiness testing** for the language of FAs, which is a way to test if a given FA accepts any string *at all*.
    - so, $E_{DFA}$ is a language such that the input of an FA, <A> is some DFA whose language is the empty set (it accepts nothing).

- $E_{DFA}$ is a decidable language
    - The way to test whether or not some DFA accepts strings or not, is by traversing along its states, marking visited states and visiting those marked states’ neighbors.
    - If we repeat this process until there are no more states to mark, then we determine whether or not we have marked some *accept* state.
        - If no accept state is marked, then we accept. Otherwise, we reject.
            - This is a representation of the *possibility* that the input DFA can reach some accept state at all.
                - DFAs do not need accept states, so some DFAs do not accept any input.
                - Thus, this language is decidable because there are only two outcomes, ≥ 1 accept state = reject, = 0 accept states, accept.
                - “rejection” here means that the DFA can accept input, and these DFAs are not part of the language of DFAs that accept NO input.
    
- $EQ_{DFA}$ is a language for which each input has *two* DFAs that recognize the **same language**.
    - $EQ_{DFA}$ is decidable
        - If A and B recognize the same language, then all the strings within the recognized language are the same.
        - Thus, we can construct a new DFA from the two input DFAs, A and B, for which the new DFA accepts all the strings that are accepted by **either** A or B, but not both.
            - this means that if A recognizes L(A), and B L(B), then the new DFA will have all the strings that are not $\in L(A) \bigcap L(B)$.
            - thus, the total language of the new DFA C, is $L(C) = (L(A)\bigcap \overline{L(B)})\bigcup(\overline{L(A)}\bigcap L(B))$.
                - this is called a **symmetric different** of two sets.
            - So, if A and B are truly equal by recognizing the same language, then the new DFA must not accept *any strings at all*.
        - Since the regular languages are closed under *union*, *intersection, complement*, then we can construct a new language L(C) from L(A) and L(B).
        - Turing machines are also able to perform these constructions and operations.
        - If we construct C, we can test whether L(C) is empty with the previous *decidable* theorem of $E_{DFA}$. If L(C) is empty, then these two sets are equal.

## Context-Free Decidability

- $A_{CFG}$ is decidable
    - the language of CFGs, given some string *w* as <G,w>. It is decidable that we can determine whether the string *w* can be generated from the CFG G.
    - Instead of $\infty$ checking all the different derivations of G and comparing them to *w*, we can do something better. Because we will never halt if the string is not actually generated by the grammar, then we must do something smarter.
    - As it turns out, that if the grammar were in Chomsky Normal Form, then any derivation of strings coming from G requires at most $2n-1$ steps, where *n* is the length of the string generated.
        - So, we can check derivations with only $2n-1$ steps to sufficiently know that the string can be generated, because only finitely many $2n-1$ step-derivations exist.
        - And since any grammar G can be converted to CNF, we can use that in the Turing Machine.
        - If any of the derivations with $2n-1$ steps are the string *w*, we accept. Otherwise, reject.
    
- $E_{CFG}$ is decidable
    - Instead of check all possible output strings, for which there are infinitely many, we can use the properties of CFGs and terminals.
    - In order for *any* string to be generated from a grammar, it must output terminals at some point.
        - Thus, for this decidability algo., we must determine for **every variable** whether it is able of generating terminals
            - To do this, we scan all the rules of the CFG, marking all terminals
            - Then, we scan again to mark off all variables are marked, and only mark them if that variable (A) has a rule that defines other variables that have been already marked.
            - If the start variable is NOT marked, then we accept.
                - Again, this means that the grammar does not generate strings of ONLY terminals, and is empty.
            
- $EQ_{CFG}$ is NOT decidable
    - Unlike $EQ_{DFA}$, we are dealing with *context-free languages*, which are NOT closed under intersection, nor union, nor complement. Thus, we cannot use the symmetric difference here.

- Every Context-Free Grammar is Decidable
    - Converting PDAs into Turing Machines is an idea, but not the best one. Because we can convert PDAs into TMs, that will present some difficulty in the fact that PDAs may continue simulation forever without halting. And because we convert this into a Turing Machine, it too, will not halt. Thus, the language would not be decidable, so we must use a different method.
    - This decidability is better suited to the TM that decides whether some grammar generates a string *w* using the $2n-1$ steps property of CFGs in CNF.
        - If this machine is to accept, then we decide to accept. Otherwise, we reject.
        - This means that this language that we accepted on *is* decidable.

- Since CFGs and PDAs are bi-convertible ($CFG \rarr PDA$ and $PDA \rarr CFG$), then all of these decidability theorems apply to PDAs as well.

# 4.2 Undecidability

- Despite computers, automatons, and machines being powerful enough to represent and pattern very specific languages, they are limited.
- We know this, because there maintains a class of languages that are **undecidable**, in other words, some problems are NOT solvable. We cannot construct a finite algorithm that will solve these problems, or test membership for those languages.

- This is displayed in the example of whether a Turing machine will accept a given input string, which is a class of language called $A_{TM}$, similar to $A_{DFA}$ and $A_{CFG}$. While the classes of DFAs, NFAs, REGEXs, CFGs, and PDAs were decidable, the class of $A_{TM}$ is not.
    - That is, we cannot decide whether or not a Turing machine will accept an input string without looping.
    - This is strictly because if we use a Turing machine to simulate another Turing Machine’s states, tape, and configuration, then it is susceptible to looping without any way to work around that.
        - If the TM that we attempt to simulate loops, the recognizer of that TM also loops, and thus is not a decider.
        - We also cannot decide or determine whether algorithms do not halt, and algorithms themselves thus cannot detect whether they are not halting.

- The proof of undecidability of $A_{TM}$ uses **diagonalization**, which was a method created as a way to measure the size of infinite sets, so that we can *compare* different sets of infinite elements.
    - Two sets have the *same size* if the elements of *one set* can be paired with the *elements of the other set*.

<aside>
💡 Assume sets A and B, related by a function $f$ from A to B.

- $f$ is “one-to-one” if it **never maps** two different elements onto the same place (”injective”)
    - f(a) ≠ f(b), whenever a ≠ b
- $f$ is “onto” if it maps to *all* elements of B (”surjective”)
    - for every element of b, there is some element of *a* such that f(a) = b.
- sets A and B are the **same size** if there is a one-to-one AND onto function ($f: A \rarr B$) (”bijective”)
    - functions that are BOTH one-to-one AND onto are called a *correspondence*.
        - which means that every elements of A maps to a unique element of B.
</aside>

- Take for example the set of *natural* numbers {1,2,3,...} and the set of *even* numbers {2,4,6,...}
    - these two sets have the *same size*, because for each element of *N*, we can map onto a *unique* element of *E*
        - 1 > 2, 2 > 4, 3 > 6, 4 > 8, ...

<aside>
💡 A set is **COUNTABLE** if either it is:

- finite, OR,
- has the same size as the set of natural numbers (> 0)
</aside>

- So, any finite set is countable, because we can individually count each element to understand the size of the set.

- Or, we can find some bijection that maps every element of the natural number set to that set.
    - For example, take the set of Q, the positive *rational* numbers, where each member can be expressed as a fraction.
        - This set is countable, because there is a way to map elements from the N natural numbers to each *unique* element from Q.
        - Take this image to the right, where each row’s index is the numerator, and each col. index is the denominator.
        - We can map the set of natural numbers starting from (1/1) → 2 → 1/2 → 3 → 1/3 → 4 → 3/2 → 2/3 → 1/4 → ...
            - we skip over all *repeated terms* in the simplest terms. 2/2 = 1/1 = 1, so we do not include that in the counting, because we already have it essentially.

- Not all sets are countable, some set are **uncountable**, meaning that there is no bijection or correspondence between the natural numbers and that set. Take $\R$, this is uncountable, because numbers can have decimals which are themselves infinite, like $\pi = 3.1415926$..., and the infinitely many numbers between $1.0, 1.01, 1.001, 1.0001,...$
    - Thus, $\R$ is uncountable because there is an infinite amount of numbers between 1 and 0, which may or may not be countable itself, and this happens between every integer. Effectively, an uncountable amount of uncountable sets...
        - Let’s assume that $\R$ is countable, then there must be a bijection $f: \N \rarr \R$.
            - Thus, for every element of $\N$, we can map to some element of $\R$. We can arbitrary pick any numbers to map. The contradiction here is that no matter how many pairs of elements we can make, there will always be some arbitrary, unique number that exists in $\R$ which is not paired in $\N$, and thus it is impossible for $f$ to be a bijection.
            
- Because we know that there exists different infinities, using the correspondence between infinite and countable sets, then we can see that some languages are not decidable, but also not recognizable whatsoever.
    - This is because the set of all languages is uncountably large, but there exists countably many Turing Machines.
        - Since each TM can only recognize ONE language, then there exists languages that are not recognized by some Turing machine.
        
- Some languages are not Turing-recognizable
    - First, show that there are countably many Turing machines. This is so, because for any alphabet, there are countably many strings, we can them form a set of the sets of strings of each length ≥ 0, which is countable.
    - There are countably many TMs, because each Turing machine can encode into a string, ignoring strings that are not legal encodings of TMs. Thus, this is a countable set of TMs.
    - There are uncountable many languages, because the set of all binary sequences is uncountable, since there exists infinite binary sequences, which are uncountable proven by diagonalization (similar to $\R$)
        - if L is the set of all languages over the alphabet $\Sigma$, then we can correspond $f: L \rarr B$, where B is the uncountable infinite binary sequence.
            - L corresponds to B because for every language $A \in L$, A has a *unique* sequence encoding represented within B, whose “bits” represent whether or not some string from the set of all strings is in the language A (this is a *characteristic sequence*).
            - because L corresponds to an uncountable set, it is therefore, uncountable.
    - Since the set of all languages is uncountable, whereas the set of Turing machines *is countable*, then we cannot correspond them, and thus, some languages cannot be recognized by some Turing machine.
    
- Bring this back to $A_{TM}$, let’s prove how it is *undecidable* now.
    - Assume that $A_{TM}$ is decidable, so we have some TM called H that is a decider for this language. It takes as input <M, w>: a Turing machine M, and a string. H halts and accepts if M accepts *w*, and H halts and rejects if M *fails to accept* w.
    - Next we make a new TM, called D, that uses H as a subroutine and rejects if M accepts, and accepts if M rejects.
        - It is made to run on the description of M, so D(M) = H(M). Essentially, D calls H to determine what M does, when <M> is fed into itself as input.
        - D(<M>) = accept if M does not accept <M>, reject if M accepts <M>
    - What if D is ran on itself, such as D(<D>), so we have that D accepts if D does not accept <D>, and rejects if D accepts <D>.
        - This is a contradiction, and thus neither D nor H can exist...

- H decides $A_{TM}$, build TM D that simulates H, which takes an input <M> that flips the accept of <M>. Then, run D on itself, and D simultaneously rejects and accepts D, which is not possible.
    - Diagonalization helps us visualize how this works. For each row, it matches all the possible combinations of decider to input. The hypothetical TM D makes diagonalization impossible, because there is no value for D(<D>) because there is no possible value for the opposite of itself, twice (it’s a paradox).

![Untitled](repo/wlu/computerScience/CP414/CP414%20Foundations%20of%20Computing/4%20=%20Decidability%2051a9c0a50e074e0493f059040c8258c5/Untitled%202.png)

- We looked at *undecidable* languages, which are languages which *do not* have the restriction that they always halt - decidable languages always finish. What about Turing-unrecognizable languages, which are languages which *cannot be recognized by any machine*?
    - Very simply, if a language *and its complement language* are both Turing-recognizable, then that language is decidable.
        - Thus, any language that is undecidable, its complement is unrecognizable.
    - a language is called “co-Turing-recognizable” if it is the complement of a T*uring-recognizable* language

- Any language is decidable exactly when *both* it, and its complement are Turing-recognizable.
    - PROOF: first, if A is decidable, then it is clear that it is also recognizable, thus, its complement is also recognizable.
        - if both A and NOT A are Turing-recognizable, then we can model some machine M1 to be the recognizer of A, and M2 for NOT A, so the following machine M is a **decider** for A:
            - Simulate M1 and M2 in parallel for any input string *w*
            - if M1 accepts, accept and halt. If M2 accepts, reject and halt.
                - thus, every string *w* is either in A, or NOT A, so M1 or M2 must accept, and M halts whenever either accept, which is for every string *w*, so it is a decider.
                - this means that it accepts all strings in A, but rejects for all strings in NOT A, so M is a decider for A, and thus, A is decidable.
    
- $\overline{A_{TM}}$ is not Turing-recognizable.
    - If $\overline{A_{TM}}$ were recognizable, then $A_{TM}$ would be decidable. Since $A_{TM}$ is not decidable, then by the theorem that languages which are decidable, have it and it’s complement be recognizable, then $\overline{A_{TM}}$ is not recognizable.
