# Introduction - Jan 5th

What is actually computable? Going over the simplest models of computing, the very abstract nature of deterministic and non-deteterministic automata of computing, grammars of languages, completeness (P, NP, NP-complete, NP-hard, etc.). In essence, what problems are solvable, based on their nature and classification (complexity), and how we can solve classes of problems using automata.

What if we are given a problem which is too hard to solve? It would be trivial to try and solve it, because if it is not solvable, it goes on infinitely, but how do we know when to stop? (This is the Halting Problem). We learn *reduction techiques* and *Turing machines* to be able to understand how to reduce problems based on other problems complexitys and sub-problems.

NP-Hard Problems

- Travelling Salesman
- Coin Change
- Hamiltonian Cycle
- etc...

The point of this course  is to be able to *prove* why these problems are NP-Hard using computation techniques.
