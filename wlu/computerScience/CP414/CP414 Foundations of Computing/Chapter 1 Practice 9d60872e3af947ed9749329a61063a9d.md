# DFAs & Operations

- Intersections
    
    Given two DFAs, their INTERSECTION (a string must be in BOTH languages) has the following properties
    
    a) the number of states of the intersection of the DFAs is the *multiplication* of both DFA’s number of states. Each of the intersection’s states is marked by a *pair* of states of the original DFAs. 
    
    b) the transition function is constructed by simultaneously being in both original states, and for each character, we go to the next state that would be the paired state
    
     - for example, if we are at (q1, s1) and for the character ‘a’, q1 → q3, and s1 → s1, then the resulting state is (q3, s1).
    
    c) the start state is the state pair which has BOTH start states from EACH original DFA
    
    d) the accepting state is similar, requiring BOTH DFAs accept states
    
- Unions
    
    Given two DFAs, their UNION (a string must be in EITHER language) has the following properties:
    
    a) The number of states of the union of DFAs is the *multiplication* of each DFAs states, in which each state is a *pair* of states from each DFA.
    
    - ie. if DFA1 has 3 states, and DFA2 has 4 states, then the union has 12 states (4x3 = 12), and each of those 12 states, is a pair that has 1 state from DFA1, and the other from DFA2
        - (q1,s1), (q1,s2), ... all 12 pairs
    
    b) the transition function is identical to the INTERSECTION method, where we simulate this DFA of paired states using simultaneously traversing both original DFAs. For each state, we determine the paired state each state goes to, based on the transition of each member of the pair.
    
    c) the start state is the pair that contains BOTH start states
    
    d) the accepting state is the core difference between UNIONs and INTERSECTIONS. 
    
    a) in a union of DFAs, the accept states are ALL pairs which contain accept states from EITHER DFA.
    
    - for example, if DFA1 had accept q3, and DFA2 had accepting s2, then all pairs which contain EITHER q3 OR s2 would become accept states.
    - this is the representation that a union of DFAs must accept when EITHER DFA accepts, which is what is different from the intersection.
    
    b) the intersection requires BOTH accept states, because it represents accepting when BOTH DFAs accept, and not only one of them.
    
- Complement
    
    The complement of a FA can only easily work on DFAs. This is the simplest operation, and it only requires flipping all non-accepts to accepts, and accepts to non-accept states. The DFA now only accepts strings that have been rejected before, effectively flipping the language.

Converting NFAs to DFAs

1) Find all the possible states of the NFA

a) this is the **power-set** of the NFA’s states, meaning that we take all the possible subsets of states. If an NFA has 4 states (1, 2, 3, 4), then the power-set is:

- {empty, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {3,4}, {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {2,3,4}, {1,3,4}, {1,2,3,4}}
- there are $2^n$ number of possible states then, where n is the number of states of the NFA.

b) the start state is the same, original start state.

- this is unless the start state has an empty-arrow that transitions out of it, then the start state is a simultaneous two states, the start and whichever other state it transitions to.

c) the accept states in the DFA are all the sets of states which have any of the original NFA accept states in them.

- if an NFA has s2 as an accept state, then any set of states that has s2 in it, becomes an accept state in the DFA.

d) create an empty-state { } (a ‘dead-state’) that represents transitions in the NFA that do not exist on states.

- for example, if state 1 has no outbound arrows to any states in the NFA, then it implicitly transitions to the dead-state  in the DFA.

e) construct the transition function of the DFA by creating a table, with rows for each set of new states in the DFA, and columns of possible character transitions (not counting the empty transition).

- to construct transitions on these sets of states, think about the ability of the NFA that makes it able to simultaneously be in two or more states at once. This is the key.
- for example, to transition from a state that is {1,2}, think about the possibility that we are in both state 1 and state 2 at once, then what states do we end up in given a character input? if state 1 on input a goes to state 3, then state 2 on a goes to state 1, then the resulting transition goes to state {1,3}.
    - {1,2} → {1,3} (or {1,2} → {3,1}, but order of the sets does not matter)

f) minimize the DFA by removing any states that have no inbound connections, ie, the unreachable nodes. This can *cascade* into creating more unreachable nodes, which can also be removed.

# Regex

Converting DFAs and NFAs to GNFAs

1) Add two new states, a start and accept state.

a) for the newstart state, add a $\epsilon$  arrow going from the new start to the old start.

b) for the new accepting state, add $\epsilon$  arrows from all old accepting states to the single new one. the old accepting states no longer accept.

2) convert any multi-character transitions (a,b) to union notation → $a\bigcup b$.

Converting GNFAs to Regex

1) Pick any state, and “rip it out” by finding all the affected paths that include that state.

a) For each affected path, use this formula to “compensate” for the lost patterns that occur when you rip out a state.

2) Keep eliminating states, until there are only the new start and accept states left. The remaining regex pattern represents the language that was represented by the original NFA/DFA.

a) the most difficult portion of this problem is when looking for affected paths. Try to ‘walk the path’ and see what patterns are necessary to make paths transition.

Convert Regex to NFA

1) Start by picking out all the patterns of regex

a) for example, take $(ab\bigcup a)^*$ . There are two main patterns: $ab$ and $a$. The operators brigde together patterns.

b) the important thing to note here, is that these are *maximal* automatons, so it makes it much easier to bridge together patterns this way.

c) something also important, is that when we concatenate two patterns, the accept state of the first turns into a non-accept state, bridged by an empty transition. This represents that the concatenation requires *both* patterns to accept. This remains true for when we concatenate onto the end of a pattern like $(ab \bigcup a)^*$ , meaning both accept states for both branches of patterns branches off into the concatenation, turning into non-accept states.
